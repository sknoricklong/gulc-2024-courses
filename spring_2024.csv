"This interactive skills-based course will put students in the roles of counsel and witness in a simulated due process hearing under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”).  Due process hearings are similar to bench trials, with opening statements, direct and cross-examination of witnesses and closing arguments, however, they are conducted in front of a hearing officer. The due process hearing in this course involves claims that a public school district has violated the IDEA by: (i) failing to appropriately evaluate and identify a third grade student with a disability; and (ii) failing to provide a “free and appropriate public education” to the student.
Through reading assignments and classroom discussion, the students will become familiar with key provisions of the IDEA, and ethical considerations arising in IDEA proceedings. They will also become familiar with the materials in the Due Process Hearing Packet provided by the instructor and containing everything the students need to create their hearing strategy and conduct the hearing. The students will be assigned to teams and tasked with collaboratively creating a hearing strategy to present their client’s case, and then individually preparing and presenting certain pieces of the case (e.g., opening statement, closing argument, direct and cross-examination of witnesses). The students will not prepare pleadings or any of the written submissions normally involved in due process proceedings.
The hearing will be conducted in phases, to allow for constructive peer and instructor feedback and self-reflection (through discussion and journal entries) after each phase, as follows: Phase 1 Opening statements; Phase 2 Complainant’s case in chief/Respondent’s cross and objections; Phase 3 Respondent’s case in chief/Complainant’s cross and objections; Phase 4 Closing Arguments. At the conclusion of the hearing, the students will discuss the merits of each party’s case, lessons learned, and whether their perspective on ethical considerations raised at the beginning of the course has changed, now that they have “stood in the shoes” of counsel litigating the educational rights of a child with a disability.",LAW 1802 v00,A Due Process Hearing Simulation: Protecting The Rights of a Student With a Disability,Limit: 16,"Prerequisite:

"This seminar will cover the history and present of abolitionist movements in the United States and the role of law in resisting or hastening abolition, mainly of slavery, but also of prisons and policing today. The first half of the course will present a legal history of abolitionism. Students will learn about the founding constitutional accommodations to slavery and the role of the Supreme Court in enforcing those constitutional protections of enslavers prior to the Civil War. They will also learn about the modes of abolitionist resistance to slavery, including freedom suits by enslaved persons and legal challenges on behalf of fugitives as well as abolitionists’ petitions to state and federal legislatures to end slavery. They will read and engage with iconic primary abolitionists texts from the colonial, revolutionary and pre-Civil War eras to understand the moral, constitutional, and political arguments levelled against slavery. They will also read and understand the original intentions of the drafters of the Reconstruction Amendments and engage with their conception of “abolition democracy,” that is, the democratic society they hoped to create to ensure freedom and equality for the formerly enslaved. The second half of the course will engage with abolition now, particularly the legal and social movements for abolition of modern slavery, prisons, and endemically violent policing. Students will read excerpts from signature works on contemporary abolitionism, including key law review articles on prison and policing abolition and on “abolitionist constitutionalism.” They will grapple with the relevance of abolitionist thought to modern aspirations concerning individual freedom, equality, and democracy.
Learning Outcomes: (1) Students will learn about the role of abolitionists and abolitionist thought in shaping American law and guarantees of freedom and equality. (2) Students will demonstrate an ability to produce an original, high quality research paper. (3) Students will demonstrate an ability to give constructive feedback on the work of their peers. (4) Students will engage in critical analysis of the gap between our professed founding ideals of freedom and the reality for historically and presently subordinated persons and develop concrete ideas in their papers on what to do about it.",LAW 1849 v00,Abolitionism and the Law Seminar,Limit: 18,,,,,Sheryll D Cashin,https://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/?redirect=RzAwMzIwNTg3,,,,,Th 10:00am-12:00pm (1/16 to 4/27)
"The course will look at the treatment of reproductive rights in early America through the mid-1800’s and to the legalization of abortion. We will examine how we got from Roe v. Wade to Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Care and discuss the legal and practical impact of the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe, as well as state attempts to ban or restrict abortion. The course will directly address Institutional Learning Objective 8 by requiring students to think critically about the law’s claim to neutrality and its differential effects on subordinated groups, including those identified by race, gender, indigeneity, and class and consider whether one person’s moral or ethical position should prevail when that position has disparate negative impacts on marginalized communities. We will look at how the law is intersecting with issues of race, sex, class, religion, sexual orientation, and politics to shape the culture of the country and our individual lives. The course will conclude with a review of the current legal battles relating to abortion, emergency contraception, assisted reproduction and gender affirming care, and discuss the legal theories at play, which are being used by both sides of the debate in competing iterations.",LAW 3166 v00,Access to Reproductive Healthcare Under the Law (How We Got to Dobbs and What’s Next?),,"Prerequisite:

"The ongoing development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies poses significant challenges and opportunities that the law must grapple with. This course will explore some of the normative and theoretical questions raised by the use of AI tools in different legal contexts. Topics to be covered include the use of AI as a substitute or guide for professional judgment; the use of AI as part of systems of government enforcement and adjudication; the use of AI by the private sector to predict, manage, and differentiate consumers; and the use of AI to generate texts, sounds, images, and other products. 
Throughout, we will consider the principles at issue in debates over AI in the context of specific case studies of real world AI legal “problems.” We will ask whether existing legal theories and frameworks are up to the task of fostering the beneficial use of AI or whether and where new approaches may be necessary. We will also explore how understanding the marginal costs and benefits associated with AI sheds light on the uses and limitations of unassisted human judgment in the legal system as it currently exists.
No technical background is assumed. 
Learning Objectives: This course is designed for students to improve their understanding of the following: (1) how artificial intelligence works, both in terms of existing technology as well as the pace and nature of its ongoing development; (2) how artificial intelligence is employed by the private and public sectors; (3) the concerns and hopes that these uses raise; (4) the possibilities and limitations of regulatory approaches to managing those concerns and encouraging AI’s benefits; and (5) how to identify what kinds of claims and concerns are driven by realistic assessments of current and near-future technology versus “hype” or ungrounded projections.",LAW 1852 v00,AI and the Law Seminar: Principles and Problems,Limit: Varies by section,,"Note:

"This intensive one-credit course will take twelve students through a fast-paced, real-life M&A situation with potentially significant antitrust implications over the course of three days. Students will represent a hypothetical client who has received an unsolicited indication of interest from a competitor and have to weigh that offer against alternative transactions presenting less risk. With time of the essence, the students will have to analyze the antitrust implications of the various alternatives and make a recommendation regarding the risks to the client’s Board of Directors. Once the Board makes its decision and the deal is negotiated (with the help of the students in respect of the provisions in the merger agreement with antitrust implications), it will then become their responsibility, as outside counsel for the company, to convince the antitrust authorities that the transaction is not anticompetitive.
Students will be informed of the scenario a few days in advance, and provided with the relevant background materials, in order to be ready for the course. The students will play the role of associates in a firm that is the outside counsel to the company that is the subject of the scenario. The goal of the course is to simulate through this hypothetical M&A scenario, the legal skills needed to guide a client’s strategic and tactical business decisions in a real-life antitrust sensitive situation.
This course will be highly interactive. Working in teams and individually over three class sessions, the students will perform a ""quick and dirty"" antitrust analysis of the alternatives, evaluate/negotiate the antitrust risk shifting provisions in the merger agreement, present the analysis to the Board, and present a Day 1 presentation to the antitrust authorities. The students will be allocated tasks throughout the week as they would in a real life/real time private practice situation. The students will work with a practicing antitrust M&A lawyer from an international New York City firm as the ""partner"" on the matter who will give out assignments, review written material, and otherwise coordinate the team.",LAW 1530 v00,Antitrust in Action: Evaluating the Deal and Advising the Board of Directors,Limit: 10,"Prerequisite:

"This 2 or 3 credit seminar will provide an overview of the underlying and competing laws and policies arising from the assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) that continually make front page news. Since the 1980 opening of the country’s 1st IVF clinic amidst protests and pickets, courts and legislatures have struggled to create laws and policies in response to continually evolving reproductive advances. Topics will include: the legal status of the IVF embryo in the context of procreative rights (highlighted by the currently changing and challenging legal context); embryo cryopreservation, storage, disposition and mix-ups; legal implications of advances in egg freezing, reproductive genetics and oncofertility; posthumous reproduction; egg and sperm donation; traditional/genetic and gestational surrogacy; unique issues for single and same-sex couples, including the impact of legally recognized same-sex marriage; and professional and regulatory aspects of the ARTs.
Two classes that will examine selected legal and policy aspects of comparative ART law perspectives on “third-party ART” and the impact these differences have on cross-border reproductive practices, with a particular focus on surrogacy.

"In this course, using clips from and simulations relating to popular TV shows, including Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, we discuss privilege issues that come up in civil litigation. Because privilege issues arise in every aspect of a litigation—whether it be ensuring that proper measures are taken to preserve privilege or challenging an adversary’s improper assertion of privilege to gain access to relevant information—understanding the parameters of the attorney-client privilege, the work-product doctrine, and related privileges is a key component to zealous representation with which all litigators need to be familiar. For junior attorneys especially, knowing how to spot and understanding how to analyze potential privilege issues is a vital skill, as junior attorneys are frequently the first to come across these issues, during interviews of clients and witnesses, the review of documents in discovery, and depositions.
  This course is designed as an in-depth analysis of privilege issues that can arise during the lifecycle of a case, including the representation of multiple clients, the application of privilege within corporations and extending that privilege to its advisors, and compelling discovery improperly claimed as privileged. In this course, we will review the key concepts of privilege law through mini-lectures, discussions of scenes from TV shows, articles, and recent legal opinions, and engaging in hypothetical situations and role play of handling privilege issues with clients, opposing counsel, and in court. At the end of the course, students will have an understanding of the key privilege issues that arise in civil litigation, including knowing how to spot a potential privilege, evaluate the existence of the privilege, and address the issue.",LAW 1816 v00,Breaking Privilege: An In-Depth Analysis of Privilege Issues in the Context of Civil Litigation,Limit: 24,,"Note:

"Corporations today have a global scale as well as an impact that matches or sometimes exceeds that of governments. Their activities -- from sourcing of raw materials, to processing and production of intermediate or finished goods, to distribution and sale -- have major consequences not only for the human rights of their employees but also for the rights of the individuals and communities impacted by their operations. In many countries, government regulation and oversight are either absent or largely ineffective. Companies in turn struggle to define their responsibilities in the face of these ""governance gaps"" -- particularly where requirements under national law fall short of international standards in areas such as hours of work and safety and healthy.
A robust and often contentious debate over these issues culminated in the development of the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (the “UNGPs”) under the leadership of Special Representative John Ruggie. These Principles establish a framework for considering the respective roles of governments and corporations and outline core concepts of human rights due diligence and effective remedy. In doing so, the UNGPs also inform and to some extent refocus efforts that have emerged over the past 20 years to address these governance gaps and have brought together stakeholders from business, labor, civil society, the investment community, and academia.
At the same time, in recent years there has been an increased push from civil society groups and certain governments to go beyond these ""voluntary"" efforts and develop a binding business and human rights treaty mechanism; this has met with strong opposition from business and many other governments, including the United States.
Even as ""non-regulatory"" approaches remain the predominant means of addressing various business and human rights challenges, there also has been a growing focus in recent years on tools through which national governments and international institutions could exercise greater leverage. This includes advocacy for stronger labor and other human rights language in trade agreements, one-way trade preference programs, procurement standards, and the rules and guidelines applied by international financial institutions -- coupled with more aggressive enforcement of those criteria. Expanded efforts to advance that ""regulatory"" approach in trade policy and elsewhere in some cases has been met with resistance from governments and business, but there also have been examples of emerging consensus among a diverse range of stakeholders.
This course introduces students to this quickly-evolving business and human rights landscape, including the diverse set of multi-stakeholder initiatives -- some, but not all, of which include government participation. We will discuss the guidance provided by the UNGPs and other instruments, the range of stakeholders and how they engage with one another, tools utilized by governments and corporations to implement human rights standards, and how all of these interact in the context of both sector-specific and cross-cutting legal and policy challenges.
Among the questions the course will examine are:
Which human rights standards are most relevant to business?
What are the appropriate linkages between business policies and practices and the promotion of human rights?
Which business and human rights approaches are emerging as “best practices"" and perhaps even as recognized norms?
What tools to support those are being used by governments and corporations?
Who are the principal stakeholders and what are their roles and objectives?
What are the strategies for addressing business and human rights ""governance gaps"" at the national and international levels?
What are the opportunities for increased integration of labor/human rights and trade policies, and what are the limitations?
What mix of mandatory/regulatory and voluntary/“self-regulatory” approaches has been utilized in different situations to advance human rights objectives? Which approaches have been most effective?
How are various business and human rights challenges playing out in specific sectors, and how do these inform the debate about different approaches?
To address these and other key questions, the course will begin with several sessions setting out the relevant legal and policy developments, with special attention to the UNGPs. It will also include a review of different stakeholders and their roles and interests, and examination of concepts of corporate responsibility and corporate accountability, and an analysis of the various approaches to business and human rights advanced by companies, governments, labor, civil society, and through multi-stakeholder initiatives. The second half of the semester will then focus on how these concepts are being applied in particular sectors to address specific business and human rights challenges.
Throughout the course, students will be asked to examine the various approaches and differing roles of key stakeholders, including by playing the roles of those addressing the key issues from the perspectives of corporations, civil society and unions, and governments. The class will be divided into three groups for purposes of this “role playing” -- with each asked to adopt all three perspectives during the course of the semester, both in students’ individual analyses of assigned readings and in group sessions during certain classes.
Learning Objectives:
Introduction to business and human rights landscape, including legal and policy developments, particularly the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

"By providing a rich historical introduction to the histories of various groups of color in the United States and their encounters with white Europeans and their descendants, we will explore the themes of race and racism in a variety of doctrinal contexts. We will examine federal and state cases and legislation, which have defined the scope and limitations historically faced by minorities over time from the point of slavery to modern day. We will also examine how early social and economic realities have shaped society’s and thus the court’s view of the role of minorities in America.  Finally, we will study major cases leading to systemic change and the advancement of equal justice and at times retrenchment.
The overall themes and reading assignments for this course are directly related to Georgetown’s Institutional Learning Outcomes (ILO). Specifically, this course provides students the ability to think critically about the connections between race, history, and legal doctrine or law, and the differential effects that has on minority groups.

This course will enable students to enhance their critical thinking skills, examine and analyze legal precedents, and develop or improve their advocacy skills and legal writing.
We will examine throughout the semester why and how the law uses racial identifications in theory and in practice, which will require students to think critically about the powerful and ingrained modes of thinking about race and the impact that has on the law’s claim to neutrality. We will begin with a discussion on implicit bias and how it provides a background for understanding the twists and turns over the years of the notions of race in America. Students will then use this understanding throughout the remainder of the course to think critically about the role of implicit bias in the law as it pertains to race, ethnicity, and culture.

"This seminar will explore the practice and strategy of constitutional litigation through a close study of recent constitutional challenges to Executive Branch action.
We will begin with a brief overview of major trends in constitutional litigation against the Executive Branch. We will then address specific cases, examining the course of each litigation and exploring key strategic judgments made by parties, amici, and judges. Students will leave the course familiar with every stage of a constitutional case, from the initial announcement of an Executive Branch policy, to the decision to file suit and the drafting of a complaint, to litigation at every level of the Judiciary and in the court of public opinion, to the varied challenges that may follow a successful lawsuit. Along the way, we will consider the strategy and incentives of different litigants—including civil rights groups, private parties, cities, states, and legislators. We will also study the goals and strategies of lawyers charged with defending Executive Branch action.
Although this list is subject to change in light of ongoing developments, we likely will cover many of the following topics:
President Trump’s ""travel ban""
The exclusion of transgender persons from military service
Don't Ask, Don't Tell
The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA)
DACA and DAPA
Threats to revoke federal funds from sanctuary cities
The (unsuccessful) addition of a citizenship question on the 2020 Census
Requests by juvenile undocumented migrants to exercise abortion rights
The challenge to President Trump’s policy of blocking critics on Twitter
President Trump's compliance (or lack thereof) with the Emoluments Clauses
Efforts by the House of Representatives to compel testimony by former officials
Efforts by cities, states, and the House to obtain President Trump’s tax returns
The impeachments of President Trump

"This course will introduce students to the law and practice of corporate compliance, with particular reference to the financial sector and a critical compliance area for that sector: anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CFT). Through mini-lectures, simulation exercises (e.g., drafting of corporate compliance policies, in-house client counseling on compliance issues, briefings of senior executives on key compliance issues, identification of compliance failures, and reporting of potential wrongdoing to law enforcement and regulators), and oral and written feedback, students gain exposure to the key skill sets that lawyers performing corporate-compliance roles routinely use. This course can also serve as an introduction to materials covered in upper level elective courses such as Federal White Collar Crime or International White Collar Crime. The course does not require students to have any prior exposure to corporate-compliance issues from their first-semester courses.
For class each day, students will have certain assigned readings before class (which may include scenario-based fact patterns and mock documents for the next day’s exercises), and handle questioning in mini-problems involving witness questioning in both civil and criminal practice. The scenario for the course, as it expands during Week One, is expected to include situations such as (1) drafting and markup of a corporate AML/CFT policy to ensure appropriate inclusion of legal and other requirements pertinent to the topic; (2) client interviews involving corporate executives and employees with questions about interpretation and implementation of the AML/CFT policy; (3) public speaking to corporate executives, in the form of concise briefings on key AML/CFT-related issues and developments; (3) identification of potential AML/CFT compliance failures through questioning of corporate executives and employees; (4) reporting of potential wrongdoing to law enforcement and regulators through Suspicious Activity Reports; and (5) recommendations of possible disciplinary action against selected corporate executives and employees who appear to have engaged in various forms of misconduct.

"This course examines how attorneys and other professionals create value through transaction engineering. The course is organized in two parts. The first part of the course studies various barriers to transacting, including collective action problems, information problems, risk and uncertainty, and contracting over time, and a range of responses grounded in game theory, contract theory, and decision theory. The second part studies a series of real transactions. Students will be divided into work groups, each of which will be responsible for selecting and presenting a transaction to the class. Grades will be based on an individual problem set, the group presentation, and a take-home final examination.
Course Objective and Learning Outcomes: The objective of the course is to understand the proper role of deal lawyers. It forwards the idea of deal lawyers as transaction cost engineers who seek to increase the value of transactions by devising mechanisms to mitigate common barriers to efficient bargains. We study four types of barriers—collective action problems (free rider and holdout problems), information problems (moral hazard and adverse selection), risk and uncertainty, and contracting over time—and a number of responses (contractual and other mechanisms) grounded in game theory, contract theory, and decision theory. By the end of the course, I expect students to (i) have a good understanding of these barriers and the responses that deal lawyers have devised to overcome them and (ii) demonstrate the ability to recognize these barriers in different transaction contexts and to fashion solutions to them.",LAW 459 v01,Deals: The Economics of Structuring Transactions,Limit: Varies by section,"Prerequisite:

"The history of global health is inextricably linked to colonial conquest. The early interventions of what was then called international health were developed within colonial settings and to a large degree, were dependent on the coercive power of colonial rule. Shaped by colonial ideas that colonized peoples were incapable of improving their own health, the existence of local medical knowledge and existing public health infrastructures in colonized lands were subverted and colonial health services were designed primarily to protect the health of European and American personnel who were essential to upholding the colonial economy.” (Zeinabou Niamé Daffé et al, 2021)

COVID-19 has demonstrated that the modern global health systems, built on the foundations of colonialism, continue to perpetuate practices and laws that often result in inequitable access to health services and products, and unequal enjoyment of the right to health. Created on the foundations of tropical medicine.

"More than ever, parties to bitterly-contested legal and political questions invoke medicine to support their side.  Abortion, LGBTQ rights, criminal responsibility, racial equity, and vaccines and other measures against COVID-19 are among the areas of conflict that have drawn medical science and judgment into the mix.  Often, physicians have been eager participants, sometimes going beyond what science shows.

"This course analyzes the subject matter of global health security as it is shaped by international agreements and national implementation and preparedness laws. As societies and economies are increasingly interwoven and interdependent, new forms of health security threats have arisen, and nations are now contending with such implications through established agreements like the International Health Regulations (2005), a draft new pandemic agreement, and various forms of “soft power” diplomacy to mitigate infectious disease risks. In recent years, the realm of health security has expanded greatly with more governments, companies, and NGOs working to solve problems and pursue opportunities. Most prominently, the COVID-19 pandemic has shattered existing paradigms of stability and security, with ramifications from the global perspective down to that of nearly every world citizen. Over an immersive weekend of overview and interaction, this course highlights prominent threat categories, namely the “3-D threats” of Disaster, Disease, and Disorder. This seminar will be devoted as an active legal laboratory in which student ideas are solicited and shaped with the participation of the class.
The objective of the course is to crystallize student understanding at the international, national, and local legal level, the perspective viewed by national and organizational leaderships, and to frame student thinking by developing a broad, contextual understanding of the situation of health security. The course will draw connections between direct experience with purposeful intent through class exercises. Practical frameworks will be employed to simplify the dynamics within complex situations, and to organize student thinking about actions and options. An overnight simulation activity assessing a humanitarian crisis between the first and second day invites analysis about cause-effect, goals-intentions, and interventions-consequences. Two special guest speakers will share experiences on the policy frontlines, further enriching classroom dialogue. The course relies on active participation that feeds a mutual learning environment and that catalyzes and reveals students’ ideas as they occur, thereby fostering an at-the-ready style of nimble thinking and conversing.

"While the public tends to think about capital punishment in relation to a high court's ruling to prevent or allow an execution to go forward, the broader campaign to expose the flaws in the practice of capital punishment and to end the death penalty involves a complex interplay of strategies--federal and state legislative advocacy, strategic communications, and community organizing and litigation. Indeed, nearly every human rights challenge requires a combination strategy, with many moving parts that have different targets, different tactics, and require different skills. How does an advocate know which strategies are appropriate for which challenges?  How can you best prepare for some of the thorniest, most entrenched challenges to human rights? What tools are available to you?  And what if the combination of strategies creates ethical or other tensions? This course will explore the various ways in which litigation and policy advocacy can work together to bring about transformative change on complex and difficult human rights concerns. The discussion will be grounded in the long-term effort to end capital punishment in the United States and it will draw on lessons learned from other human rights campaigns.
This seminar will 1) introduce students to multidisciplinary campaigns for human rights and 2) explore how litigation and policy advocacy can be combined and leveraged to create opportunities to advance human rights.  Students will explore the range of strategies and tactics available and learn when and how to deploy them.  
At the end of the seminar, each student or team of students will have led fellow students through a logic model exercise, prepared a high level multidisciplinary strategy memorandum and led a mock coalition meeting to achieve alignment and engagement on their plan.
There is no textbook for the seminar.  Readings will include legal, academic, and general articles and materials on the subjects being covered.
Learning Objectives: The primary objective of this course is for students to understand the range of disciplines and tools available to them to implement a successful campaign and to identify synergies that can be achieved between litigation; policy advocacy, strategic communications and organizing. Students completing the course will understand which strategies to use when and how to navigate the potential conflicts between them.

"Slavery has been a phenomenon that has existed since before written history, yet it is only in the last 200 years that efforts to abolish it have gained traction. Today, increasing mobility, global supply chains, and continued social discrimination have created the environment for ongoing human exploitation, even though the formal practice of chattel slavery, or the legal ownership of one human being by another, is illegal virtually everywhere. Indeed, some estimate that there are more slaves today than at any other time in human history. Most recently, efforts to eliminate severe forms of human exploitation are being made under the banner of ending human trafficking (or more formally, trafficking in persons).
This course will provide students an overview of the multiple legal perspectives on combating human trafficking and modern slavery. This will include the definitional tensions between different perspectives, alternative approaches to addressing severe human exploitation, and an overview of the current U.S. legal framework for eradicating human trafficking and modern slavery and its weaknesses. Attention will be paid to commonly recognized principles in human rights, criminal and labor law, but also in such areas as corporate responsibility and immigration law. The class will use a range of materials, including international treaties, decisions of international and foreign tribunals, and more familiar U.S. statutory materials and legislative history (such as committee reports).

"The global trade in arms is estimated to be worth at least $127 billion dollars (in 2021, the most recent year for which data is available), and has been increasing since 2015. This trade involves not only major powers such as the USA, Russia, and China but also many countries in the global North and South. It also involves a range of technologies, from light weapons and ammunition to aircraft, missiles, drone systems, weapon launchers, through intelligence, information and cyber systems. Recent human rights activism and investigative journalism have drawn public attention to the devastating human rights implications of the trade in what are deemed “conventional” arms.

Yemeni and European human rights lawyers have initiated legal proceedings against European corporations for complicity with war crimes committed by Saudi Arabia in Yemen with weapons purchased in Europe. Seventeen news organizations joined hands with Amnesty International to investigate Israeli spyware Pegasus, revealing how it has provided authoritarian rulers with the means to surveil their populations and concentrate power.
Indeed, beyond the taking of life, the arms purchased legally by states around the world directly and indirectly harm a wide range of human rights protected in international law, including health, liberty, privacy, free speech and association, and religious freedom. In this course we will explore how international law regulates the global arms trade, focusing on the place of human rights considerations in this regulation. This international regulation is fractured. While weapons of mass destruction and weapons deemed particularly cruel or destructive are subject to specific bans or stringent transfer restrictions, the trade in the bulk of conventional weapons is subject to norms deriving from international humanitarian law, international criminal law, international human rights law, international trade law, non-binding multilateral regimes coordinating export controls, and binding and non-binding rules on business and human rights. After an introduction to the history, trends and political science of the global arms trade, we will discuss the above legal norms and their enforcement mechanisms. In addition to legal sources such as treaties and case-law, we will read scholarship in international law and international relations critically assessing the law from a human rights perspective. The course’s overarching aim is to understand whether international law limits the global arms trade’s harms to human rights, or to the contrary facilitates them. In the process, by examining how various subfields of international law address the arms trade, we will explore the relative strengths and weaknesses of these subfields to protect human rights, of formally binding rules and soft law, and of regulation targeting states, individuals and corporations.   
Learning Objectives:
The main learning objective is for students to understand the various international norms regulating the arms trade, including the emerging body of scholarly literature in international law and international relations discussing those norms. Until recently, the international regulation of the conventional arms trade was severely under-studied and under-researched. The course will introduce students to the principal scholars in the field, enabling them to continue researching these issues should they wish to do so in the future. This course will also introduce students to the global arms trade, its main economic and geo-political characteristics, and its human rights implications. They will also learn about the main sources of reliable information about this trade.
More broadly, through discussions in class drawing on legal and international relations literature, the course aims to help students develop critical perspectives on international law, in particular on questions of norm fragmentation, norm enforcement, North-South relations, and the relations between humanitarian and economic considerations. By focusing on a narrow question (the human rights implications of the arms trade) and examining how it is addressed in various subfields of international law, the students will also develop a comparative perspective on these subfields, and hopefully reach new understandings on some of the characteristics, and strengths and weaknesses of each.",LAW 1877 v00,"International Law, the Global Arms Trade and Human Rights",Limit: Varies by section,"Prerequisite:

"Global climate change is most significant environmental challenge of the 21st century. Because the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) result from virtually every kind of economic activity -- driving a car, heating a home, operating a cement factory, raising chickens -- any policy aimed at reducing emissions will have significant and broad-based impacts on domestic economies around the world.  And because most of those economic activities involve the movement of goods, services, people or intellectual property rights across international borders, policy actions taken in response to climate change can implicate global trading rules.
As countries around the world adopt different approaches to addressing the threat of climate change, the risk of conflict between basic rules governing international trade and measures taken to control GHG emissions rises.  This seminar will explore those overlaps and potential for conflict versus the opportunity for the global trading system to contribute to the reduction in GHG emissions.  The course will include a survey of the basic international rules touching on climate change, including the Paris Agreement, underlying UNFCC documents, the UN’s sustainable development goals, human rights agreements and the basic international trade rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and key regional agreements, including the EU treaties and the USMCA.  It will examine a number of the key issues at the intersection of trade and climate, including whether and under what conditions countries can impose a carbon border adjustment mechanism that is consistent with the WTO rules; the increasing use of government subsidies to promote the development and use of green technologies and whether new rules on subsidies are needed to regulate them; the increased clamoring for the sharing of cutting-edge green technologies, notwithstanding the WTO’s intellectual property rules; the growing volume of cross-border trade in electricity and the expansion of renewable energy and intellectual property rights feeding into internationally-operated smart grids; the need for the development of accepted and enforced standards for “green” finance; and the implications of climate change for human rights and immigration policies as rising sea levels, severe droughts and extensive fires force massive migrations.
The seminar will also explore the areas in which the trading system could make a positive contribution to the fight against GHG emissions, including the options for limiting fossil fuel and fishery subsidies and supporting the financing of renewable energy facilities.  In addition, it will examine whether the current exceptions to the trading rules provide sufficient policy space for innovative approaches to climate change.
Learning Objectives: The primary objective of this course is for students to develop an understanding of the potential for conflicts between trade measures and trade rules with efforts to restrain or tax GHG emissions, along with WTO-consistent policy and financial options to support the fight against climate change. The course will give students to opportunity to develop cutting-edge proposals of significant value to political and thought leaders around the world about how best to use the trading system to support climate mitigation and adaptation measures.",LAW 1770 v00,International Trade Rules and Climate Change Seminar - Can the Two Get Along?,Limit: Varies by section,,"Note:

"This course will examine the connection between trade law and development, including aspects of international and regional trade agreements, comparative law, and diverse areas of market regulation at the national level. Overall, the seminar will highlight the role of law and regulation as a driver for sustainable development and inclusive growth and link broader legal frameworks and policy debates with the needs of individuals and enterprises. It will engage students in ways in which economic law can help encourage sustainable and inclusive development and will assess challenges associated with legal and regulatory capacity and the uneven implementation of laws in practice. Cross-cutting and inter-disciplinary approaches in the field, such as socio-legal approaches, human rights, food security, the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and gender and trade will also be discussed throughout the seminar.
The seminar will take place in three phases. In Phase I, the seminar will explore the historical and institutional relationship between trade and development, including World Trade Organization (WTO) disciplines, regional trade agreements (RTAs), and other relevant international legal frameworks.  Phase II will focus on different issues and will cover a number of substantive aspects of trade and development in depth, all of which impact stakeholders and communities and hold greater potential to contribute to the common good.  Specific areas of focus will include domestic market regulation and investment, non-tariff measures, regulation of services, trade facilitation, agriculture, labor and environment, intellectual property rights, gender, and digital trade.  Phase III of the course will consist of an in-class exercise to apply the theory and substantive legal approaches discussed in Parts I and II in the context to practical trade and development challenges. 
Readings will be drawn from a variety of viewpoints and sources – law review articles, white papers, academic journals, newspapers and magazines, and excerpts from books – and will cut across trade and economic law, inclusive economic development, and business.  The readings will highlight different aspects of the legal and regulatory environment in the context of encouraging sustainable and inclusive development globally and at the grassroots level. Discussion questions will be provided for each session, which can be used as the basis for class preparation
The course will also incorporate short, practical case studies that illustrate how different issues in trade, development, and economic regulation can be applied from the perspective of different stakeholders (entrepreneurs, countries, and communities).  Seminar members will be asked to assume roles in discussion of these case studies, which will count towards class participation and lay the groundwork for the final paper.  Questions to guide the case study analysis will also be provided.

"Federal judges wield enormous power in our democracy, influencing nearly every aspect of American life.  Recent years have seen increasing numbers of decisions on some of the most salient issues of our time, including civil rights, abortion, guns, economic regulation, and religious liberty. As a result, the political parties, progressive and conservative organizations, and business groups, devote substantial resources and energy for control over the judicial selection process.  Debates over the confirmation of judicial nominees are often highly visible and contentious and are used as platforms to articulate views about what the law should be. Sometimes, the hearings serve to elevate issues such as sexual harassment and racial justice into the public domain for the nation to consider and debate.
This seminar will provide an overview of presidential nominations to the lower federal courts and Supreme Court since George Washington, with an emphasis on the years since the early 1980’s when the Reagan Administration dramatically altered the selection of judges.  It will compare and contrast the processes used by different presidents in picking judges, explore the role of outside groups and the parties, and examine the ways in which failed nominations set the stage for bitter partisanship. Reliance by the Biden Administration on demographic and experiential diversity will be highlighted as well as recent discussions related to structural reform of the Supreme Court. The seminar will conclude with an assessment of the impact that politicization of the federal judiciary has had on American life and society. During the semester, a number of outside speakers from the Senate, White House, and organizations will share their experiences and insights.
Learning Objectives:  Students will gain an understanding of the reasons why, and consequences of, increasing polarization of the process of selecting federal judges.  They will learn about the process used by past administrations, the changes that have occurred over the years, and the impact of those changes on the process. Students will also be exposed to the different eras in American politics as seen through public debates around judicial nominations.  They will have the opportunity to review and debate several aspects of the process as well as proposals to reform the Supreme Court.",LAW 1778 v00,"Judicial Politics: The Role of the White House, Congress, and Outside Groups in Selecting Judges and Justices",Limit: Varies by section,,,,,Nan Aron,https://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/?redirect=RzAwOTU5NjA0,,,,,M 5:45pm-7:45pm (1/16 to 4/27)
"This is a 2- credit seminar examining modern day labor law interpretation and enforcement, with a particular focus on how the National Labor Relations Act, an eight decade old statute, is being applied to the 21st century workforce. This course will examine the application of National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to the private sector workforce under Obama, Trump and Biden administrations. This will involve a study of the uniquely described “gig” workforce, joint employer status, independent contractors, graduate students, contingent and immigrant workers and others.  The course will explore the impact of working under modern business models, technological advancement, electronic communication and the effect of social media. We will examine the effectiveness of protections afforded to employees exercising their rights to address terms and conditions of employment, through their unions, and in non unionized workplaces by means of employee collective action. We will study how the Boards of several recent administrations applied the NLRA in this modern age.  We will also examine how a change in administration has affected the way the NLRA is interpreted and enforced.
The course is organized into general topic areas; in each two- or three-week unit we will focus on a particular issue, such as:
 statutory framework of the NLRA and its rights and limits
concerted activity for mutual aid and protection.
the cyber workplace: new technologies & challenges.
the “gig” economy, students, immigrants, contingent workers.
identifying who is classified as an employee and employer.
There are no prerequisites although labor law is recommended.
Course Goals
By the end of the semester, students should be able to do the following:
Demonstrate a general understanding of the impact that modern business models, technological advancement, electronic communication and changing administrations has on how laws are interpreted and applied to the modern workforce.
Recognize how the NLRB and other agencies charged with providing worker protections have changed over time and understand what has driven those changes.
Critically assess legal and historical scholarship on the NLRB and courts’ role in interpreting and enforcing the labor laws.
Critically assess the structure and intent of key elements of the NLRA and its effectiveness in the modern workplace.

"The point of this course is to provide the tools and some of the experience of working in or with a large law firm pro bono practice. We do this through three primary means: lecture (not just from the professors, but also from law firm and legal services leaders in the community); reading current materials on pro bono and the state of the legal market; and role-playing, using our mock law firm, Rodriquez Zimmerman & Drysdale. Each student will have a specific role in that fictional law firm, and we will provide access to more firm financial information than you will likely have at any other firm when you start (and certainly more than you would ever have from the outside). Alas, it is fictional – but trust us, it is realistic.
To understand how pro bono works in a large law firm, you first need to be familiar with how a large law firm itself works, both internally and in the market. The beginning of this course focuses on what we broadly call “law firm economics,” but just as well could be called “operations” or “management” or “finance.” We want you to understand these subjects so that you can answer this question – and then argue or defend the answer in the future: how is it that the Top 100 revenue-producing law firms in the United States contribute, on average, about 60 hours of free legal services per attorney each year? What does the donation of 1½ weeks of productivity do to the firm’s bottom line?
Then we will focus on the how and why of pro bono practice. Where did this impulse to provide free legal services come from? How do law firms decide which matters to take, and which to decline? There is a vigorous debate in the law firm pro bono community about “what counts” as pro bono work – there is even a small treatise with that very name (included in the reading materials). Beyond the issue of qualification, how do law firms determine their pro bono priorities? How does pro bono fit within larger law firm management goals?
We will also explore pro bono from other points of view: public interest providers, law schools, corporate in-house counsel and the media. What role do these organizations play in the provision of pro bono legal services, and how do they interact with large law firm pro bono practices?",LAW 135 v01,Law Firm Economics and the Public Interest: Advancing the Commitment to Pro Bono Publico through Law Firms and Other Legal Institutions,Limit: 20,,"Note:

"This seminar will examine the characteristics that define the Civil Law and the Common Law traditions. Students will learn the roles of different relevant actors of the legal community, establishing contrasts, differences and similarities between legal traditions. The course will expose students to the Civil Law tradition, as well as cultural, linguistic, historical and political traits, that influences the ways in which clients, partners and communities from Spanish-speaking regions understand the law.
The objective of this course is to introduce students not only to the main contemporary legal traditions, but also to encourage them to think about the theory and practice of each tradition, in order to make useful and critical comparisons of the different legal systems. Throughout the class, students will understand the influence that different political events had in shaping the current legal systems of Spanish-speaking countries and will have the opportunity to discover the relations and interactions between domestic legal systems and international legal systems. The comparative law perspective of this course will allow students to explore, for instance, the distinctions between the United States judicial review model with constitutionality control systems in civil law countries.
The seminar will build students’ practical legal concepts and terminology, and written and oral communication skills by introducing them to and reinforcing technical language and concepts in Spanish, in areas such as immigration, criminal law, commercial and civil law (including statutory interpretation and status), labor law, and family law. In-class presentations, written assignments, and readings will give students the opportunity to strengthen speaking, listening comprehension and written communication in legal Spanish.
By the end of the seminar, students will be equipped with an understanding of the different legal traditions, the strengths and weaknesses of current legal frameworks, the role of international human rights law in domestic legal systems, as well as Spanish communication skills in the context of legal practice.

"This course will engage in an in-depth exploration of legal issues that arise in the music industry and the complex ways in which the law has shaped the evolution of the industry and the industry has shaped the development of the law. We will begin with a historical unit that traces the manner in which copyright and other laws affected the development of the music industry (and vice versa) in the 20th century. Our second main unit will cover a cross-section of the current legal issues faced by the music industry and the business practices that have been and are being developed to address those legal issues, and a third main unit will focus on contractual issues that arise in recording and music publishing deals.  
While some of the specific issues covered may vary in light of ongoing developments in the law and music industry business practices, as well as student interest within the class, some of the possible topics of discussion and analysis include the distinct “bundles” of rights in music and how the industry developed to exploit them; music licensing and statutory royalty regimes; illegal Internet downloading, its effect on the industry, and the industry’s response; the changing power relationships among the players in the industry and the contractual and legal issues that emerge from those changing relationships; deregulation and the effects of horizontal and vertical integration in the industry; new distribution models and new models of consumption for music and how the law is developing to accommodate them; the changing conceptions of what it means to “own” music in light of technological innovations in the industry; payola prohibitions and their impact on the industry; the future of performance royalties for sound recordings; and legislative developments affecting the music industry.

"This seminar will examine how the U.S. government regulates and addresses national security in a global economy in which data and money flows freely and sensitive assets in the United States and abroad are owned or controlled by commercial actors. The concept of “national security” in U.S. legal doctrine and regimes is hardly new, but the impact of national security law on the private sector has expanded dynamically since September 11, 2001. The course will review the history and breadth of national security law and public policy as it relates to the private sector and the principles for the application of national security regulation to private actors.  While the seminar will address these considerations for a variety of practice areas, the primary focus of the seminar will be on how these principles apply in national security reviews of foreign investment conducted by the federal inter-agency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS. The course will use functional examples (i.e., real world cases) to explore fundamental policy questions -- e.g., what is the proper balance between security and openness in a commercial world -- as well as to evaluate the legal and practical considerations of private actors (including fiduciary duties to shareholders and reputation risk, among others) and their counsel when confronted with national security issues.  
This seminar is designed for those who are interested in how concepts of national security in the law affect private actors -- primarily, but not exclusively, businesses -- on a daily basis. There will be elements of history, but the main focus will be experiential.  Accordingly, while the course will not be a heavy reading course, preparation will be important and students may be designated (with significant advance notice) to help lead a particular class discussion. Outside experts from the Executive Branch, Congress, and the private sector may be invited to participate in certain classes.

"Government agencies have broad powers to act for the public good. This includes the ability to investigate individuals and organizations and to conduct surveillance about their activities, a capacity strengthened by recent technological advances. But the ability to perform these functions is limited by various constitutional protections, including the First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, and various statutory laws.
This course will explore the intersection of contemporary surveillance practices with the need to safeguard civil liberties. The course will place special emphasis on the ways in which surveillance is used to control and manage populations of people, the intersection between mass incarceration and surveillance, and the communities that experience the greatest degree of scrutiny. Throughout the course, we will investigate how race, faith, national origin, immigration status, penal status, class and other categories fundamentally shape who is being watched and why.
The course will begin with an exploration of privacy law and the limits that apply to surveillance practices, both electronic and non-electronic. We will examine free speech and freedom of expression under the First Amendment, search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment, and relevant statutory and regulatory laws. We will then explore an array of surveillance and policing practices.
We will also discuss how lawmakers, advocates and local communities are pushing back against overreaching policies, and situate these calls for reform amidst broader social and political movements, including Black Lives Matter. Our texts will include a variety of sources ranging from case law, legal scholarship, government manuals, and coalition letters to podcasts, TED Talks, and investigative journalism.
Learning Objectives: 
1. Introduce some of the major issues in state surveillance, law enforcement, and privacy, and critically examine different approaches to these issues;
2. Test our approaches against current and rapidly developing surveillance practices, both electronic and nonelectronic;
3. Explore the intersection between mass incarceration and surveillance, and the war on crime and the war on terror;
4. Understand how surveillance practices are used to profile and monitor particular communities, including on account of race, faith, national origin, immigration status, penal status, class and other categories;
5. Examine different methods for challenging surveillance; 6. Anticipate the durability of these methods going forward.",LAW 1360 v00,"Policing in the 21st Century: Law Enforcement, Technology and Surveillance",,,,"Recommended:

"This course addresses the ethical requirements that govern admission to the bar and the practice of law in the United States. The issues that we will explore are subject to specific (although often vague) rules that govern attorney behavior.
Our focus is on the American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct, a version of which has been adopted in virtually every State. In practice, an attorney’s ethical conduct is governed by the rules of each court that admits the attorney to practice. Class preparation will include review of the rule or rules and comments to the rules assigned for class. You should also review the assigned handouts for class as set forth below.
It is of crucial importance for each student to understand some foundational aspects of the American legal system. It is an adversary system in which the primary (but not sole) obligations are owed to the attorney’s clients. These obligations are set forth in Rules 1.1 through 1.16. Attorneys also owe obligations to courts, opposing and third parties and to the system of justice itself. The Rules that we will study from 3.1 to 8.5 will address these obligations.
It is also of crucial importance to understand that there are separate State and Federal Courts in the American judicial system. An attorney’s initial admission to practice is before the highest court of a State. The attorney may then be admitted to practice before the courts of other States and the various Federal trial and appellate courts.
Each court that admits an attorney to practice has adopted rules of professional conduct and has the authority to impose discipline for violation of its ethical rules.
Attorneys also may be subject to civil liability for professional lapses and criminal liability for violation of the law.

"This course explores the legal principles and rules that govern lawyers and law practice. We will use the Model Rules of Professional Conduct as our framework and cover topics that include the regulation of lawyers, legal malpractice, the formation and termination of the attorney-client relationship, the duties of confidentiality, zealous representation and candor to the court, the lawyer's duties to adversaries and third parties, conflicts of interest, the attorney/client privilege and the work product doctrine. We will take a problem-oriented approach and make ethical arguments in class with respect to assigned problems to help students develop the analytical tools to identify and resolve ethical issues. Our approach to solving ethical problems will use traditional methods of legal analysis, real life experiences, and theories of decision making that recognize the biases that can lead to error. We will consider situations where what seems like the right course of action may be unethical. We will also discuss how adhering to ethical rules can help make a technically competent lawyer into a great lawyer. And we will analyze how being an ethical lawyer can lead to a meaningful professional life and contribute to the public good by providing pro bono legal services and using ethical rules to help preserve a free and democratic society.

"Emblematic of the ongoing tensions between America's expansive democratic promises and its enduring racial realities, Washington often has served as a national battleground for contentious issues, including slavery, segregation, civil rights, the drug war, and gentrification. But D.C. is more than just a seat of government. The city has a rich history of local activism as Washingtonians of all races have struggled to make their voices heard in an undemocratic city where residents lack full political rights.
Tracing D.C.'s massive transformations—from a sparsely inhabited plantation society into a diverse metropolis, from a center of the slave trade to the nation's first black-majority city, from ""Chocolate City"" to ""Latte City""—the course offers students an opportunity to experience the city in which they have decided to attend law school at a deep and meaningful level. The historical narrative explored during the course is peppered with unforgettable characters, a history of deep racial division, but also hope, resilience, and interracial cooperation.
Students will develop a critical legal framework for understanding the role of law in shaping the racialized democracy of America. They will do so by engaging law cases touching on  segregation, disenfranchisement, urban renewal, and the drug war—all ways in which the law was weaponized to disproportionately impact Black people in Washington, D.C. Students will write a final paper of at least 4,000 words on a topic related to the reading, themes, and learning objectives of the class.

"During this seminar our class will read six books about policing in the United States.  We will spend two weeks on each book.  The first week we will discuss the book with each other. The second week the author will visit the class to discuss the book. Some author visits will be in person; others will visit via video conference.
Through studying these books and speaking with their authors we will learn how theories of policing have changed over time; how policing is influenced by, and in turn influences, law, politics and culture; the role that factors like race, gender, sexual-orientation, disability, indigeneity, age and class, have played in shaping how policing happens; the connection of policing to mass incarceration and its attendant  harms; and we will probe some of the biggest challenges facing policing currently.
The six books we will read include:
Unreasonable: Black Lives, Police Power, and the Fourth Amendment, by Devon Carbado
We Own This city: A True Story of Crime, Cops, and Corruption, by Justin Fenton
Becoming Abolitionists: Police, Protests, and the Pursuit of Freedom, by Derecka Purnell

"The course is designed to provide students with an opportunity to critically examine the criminal legal system and the role of public defenders within it. Students will be exposed to models of practice that challenge the notion that a public defender is simply a cog in an unjust system. Students will learn how public defenders can effectuate systemic change while securing the best outcomes for their individual clients.
The course will include readings that analyze the injustices perpetuated by the criminal legal system and their root causes. Through these readings and class discussions, students will analyze how facially-neutral laws and policies are the underpinning of a racist, classist, and unjust system. Case law and sample legal pleadings will show how public defenders have successfully challenged these systemic issues through individual client representation.
The course will also rely on presentations by directly-impacted individuals who will share their experiences with the criminal legal system, their experiences being represented by public defenders, and their struggles for justice within the system.
Overall, the course is designed to challenge existing perceptions of public defense and allow students an opportunity to learn about and explore the many ways that a public defender can challenge the injustices of the criminal legal system.
Course Goals/Learning Outcomes:
The objective of the course is to provide students with a nuanced understanding of what it means to be a public defender within a racist, classist, and otherwise unjust criminal legal system. Students will develop an understanding of the traditional role of a public defender, potential shortcomings of the traditional approach, and how the role of a public defender can be expanded to more directly challenge the systemic issues within the system. By focusing on historical injustices in the system (e.g. racism, police brutality, prison conditions), students will learn how public defenders can both zealously represent their individual clients while also challenging systemic issues. Students will analyze the historical and systemic injustices perpetuated by the criminal legal system while also learning practical litigation strategies used by public defenders to effectively effectuate change.
In line with Institutional Learning Outcome 8, this course will provide students with a practical understanding of how the criminal legal system operates. This understanding will allow students to think critically about how a criminal legal system touted as a neutral arbiter of justice is in practice a perpetuator of systemic racism, classism, and inequality.",LAW 1814 v00,Reimagining the Role of the Public Defender,Limit: Varies by section,"Prerequisite:

"This skills-based simulation course will introduce students to the essential skills of social intelligence needed in all forms of a law practice—including law firms, government agencies, corporations, nonprofits, and solo practice. Students will learn about emotional intelligence and the factors that affect their abilities to interact with clients, co-workers, and opposing counsel. Students will study neuroscientific and psychological research that illustrates how basic brain function and other factors, such as strong emotion, influence how a person makes decisions. With this knowledge, students will develop strategies to improve their own decisions and to interact effectively with clients, colleagues, and opposing counsel as they engage in various types of decision-making. Using a combination of lecture, discussion, videos, skills exercises, and simulations of legal practice scenarios, this course will emphasize concrete, practical tools to increase students’ effectiveness in managing themselves and their interactions with others. The course will equip students to effectively communicate with others, present information in a persuasive light, recognize and address their own internal biases, and deal with interactions they may find difficult. Students completing this course will have developed a solid grasp on how to address the wide variety of interpersonal dynamics that commonly arise in the legal arena.
Learning Objectives:
The main objectives of this course are to increase students’ awareness of the substantial role of social intelligence in the practice of law and to provide students with concrete skills to effectively handle day-to-day interactions. Students will learn research-based skills and strategies from the fields of neuroscience, the study of emotions and emotional intelligence, negotiation, and communication. As they learn theory, students will have the opportunity to practice techniques for harnessing these dynamics in professional interactions commonly involved in the actual practice of law. The simulations will emphasize positive strategies for dealing with common interpersonal interactions in a legal practice: lawyer–client, lawyer–opposing counsel, and lawyer–colleague. At the end of the course, students will have an improved ability to effectively communicate and negotiate, present information in a persuasive light, recognize and address internal biases, and deal with interactions they may find difficult—skills that talented legal minds need to become great counselors at law.",LAW 611 v05,"Social Intelligence in the Practice of Law: Dealing Effectively with Clients, Colleagues, and Opposing Counsel",Limit: 24,,"Note:

What changes are underway regarding the nature of regulation, attitudes about the role of the administrative state, and ways regulatory wars are fought?
Subject to adjustment and tailoring of content in light of legal developments and student interest, the seminar meetings will be organized around a mix of case studies and cross-cutting regulatory topics. For Spring 2024, the seminar will have a substantial advanced environmental and risk regulation focus, but with some materials focused more generally on regulatory disputes, methodologies and strategies, and the role of the administrative state.  Topic-based classes will likely select from among the following: critiques of assumptions of regulatory overreach and empire building; federalism and preemption as shaping regulatory choices and disputes; theories of regulation and regulatory reform proposals; recent presidential and agency deregulatory and policy change efforts and judicial and scholarly responses; debates and shifting doctrine regarding deference regimes; the shift to market-based and experimental “rolling rule” modes of regulation; “sound science” and “bought science” and the problem of regulatory lying; behavioral economics and regulatory design; and impact litigation strategies. Case study subjects will likely include a mix of the following: my own research into the 1971-85 battles over the multi-billion dollar Westway project defeated by a small number of citizens; climate change regulatory developments, state law climate actions, and federal legislative developments; and court, regulatory and legislative battles over protecting “waters of the United States” under the Clean Water Act.
Readings will include diverse materials to illuminate the art of regulatory war, including court decisions, briefs, congressional testimony, legislative and regulatory materials, statutory provisions, and scholarship. Students will before each class submit a few brief comments or questions about the readings, with class discussion building on those areas of interest. Students will have broad latitude to develop related paper topics based on their own interests and goals.

"This course investigates the federal courts’ role in United States foreign affairs. It is a commonplace that the courts take a backseat to the political branches on issues relating to foreign affairs. But that truism, though generally accurate, obscures more than it reveals, for the federal courts routinely adjudicate cases with significant implications for the United States’ relations with the world—as they have since 1789. In this course, we will explore several fundamental questions: What kinds of foreign affair issues have the courts historically addressed? How has the courts’ jurisdiction over cases implicating foreign affairs changed over time? How have the courts handled foreign and international law? What impact have separation of powers principles had on the courts’ decision-making?

The course is organized thematically; in each two- or three-week unit we will focus on a particular issue, including the foreign affairs background to the establishment of federal courts under Article III of the Constitution; the status of international and foreign law in federal court; foreign states as litigants in federal court; and the reach of the courts’ jurisdiction beyond U.S. territory. Each unit will be framed in historical perspective, exploring both the courts’ past practice and their modern approach.

This is not a survey course on the law of U.S. foreign affairs; we will not address directly many of the topics that would be covered in such a course—including the allocation of foreign affairs responsibility between the Executive and Congress; the scope of Presidential war power; and treaty-making and executive agreements. Instead, the focus here is squarely on the courts and their interactions with the world.

By the end of the semester, students should be able to do the following:
• Demonstrate a general understanding of the various ways in which the federal courts address issues that have implications for the United States’ relations with foreign nations.
• Recognize how the courts’ role in foreign affairs has changed over time, and understand what has driven those changes.
• Draw connections between different doctrinal areas and historical periods to develop a broader understanding of the court’s role in foreign affairs.
• Critically assess legal and historical scholarship on the courts’ role in foreign affairs.
• Respond constructively to classmates’ questions, comments, and ideas.",LAW 1663 v00,"The Federal Courts and the World Seminar: History, Developments, and Problems",,,,"Recommended:

"Automated systems and artificial intelligence (AI) soon will be like electricity—an ever-present technology that enables many aspects of modern society to function smoothly while operating largely in the background.  Internet-connected “smart” refrigerators and kitchen shelves in “smart” homes will order food items automatically, without human direction, when existing supplies are running low.  Factories are increasingly becoming completely automated, operated by robots that can work 24-hours a day in the dark.  AI even can handle tasks that are currently performed by doctors, attorneys, and human resources executives.  For example, computer algorithms can diagnose illnesses in patients and review documents and contracts for legal and regulatory issues.  AI systems can select the job applicants that firms call in for interviews, and then use facial recognition technology to analyze video-recordings of the interviews to determine which applicants were enthusiastic, bored, or dishonest.  Automated systems already control much of the trading on stock and futures exchanges.  Regular people who want investment advice and guidance can use their smartphones to enroll in AI-powered robo-advisory services that adjust investment strategies according to individual risk preferences.  Algorithms used by online retailers decide what products to show people based on analysis of both the shopping habits of specific individuals and the behavior patterns of like-minded shoppers.  Taxis of the future may very well be self-driving cars that are robot business entities that own themselves.        
These radical changes in society will have significant implications for the legal system.  Advances in AI will necessitate changes to laws and regulations, and even to how lawyers practice law.

"This course will review the most critical policy, legal and regulatory issues faced by the energy sector (coal, oil, gas, renewable energy sources, and minerals) actors, such as governments, investors, corporations, insurers, and citizens, when facing the challenges of the current energy transition, including net-zero pledges at political level and their impact in legislation.  
The discussion will be based on the following premises/problems (evidently, the premises could also be discussed as well):  
The world has a carbon emissions problem. Science confirms that action is needed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the atmosphere generated by human activities. 
The planet works on fossil fuels today, and it seems it will do so for the foreseeable future. Therefore, an abrupt reduction of fossil fuel consumption will severely disrupt current lifestyles, especially in developed countries.  
A sharp increase in renewable energy generation will require much more mineral extraction than today, an activity that itself brings new social and environmental challenges. 
Even with the current fossil fuel consumption, a significant share of the world population has unreliable, insufficient, or inexistent access to energy (approx. 800 million people). This situation is unacceptable and needs to be solved. 
The energy matrix change towards renewable energy sources will disrupt both producing and exporting countries and corporations across the globe. The consequences of such change have to be foreseen and prevented, if negative.   
Development is a pending task for most of the planet, and it needs a priority place in the environmental discussions. Through the different topics addressed in the course, we will analyze how weak rule of law, increasing environmental and social challenges, corruption, and geopolitical challenges affect policymakers, legislators, regulators, and the private sector decision-making processes related to the energy transition, environment and development. Energy actors and the finance sector are confronted with long-term capital investment decisions in a volatile policy and regulatory environment. Legal counsel in these cases involves a substantial role in evaluating and mitigating risk and in the prevention and resolution of disputes. The course will analyze the extra-legal factors that lawyers need to understand to provide advice more comprehensively. 
Participants in the course will better understand the energy sector transaction models in the context of the current energy transition, the emerging challenges, and the legal strategies used to mitigate such risks using regulatory frameworks, contract drafting, and compliance procedures (ESG). Topics will include a general explanation of the risk or opportunity in each situation discussed, using study cases of specific transactions whenever possible. 
This course is not a project finance or a specialized finance course, even though we will review some financing structures. Due to its structure, this course could be considered an overview of the most pressing issues discussed in international energy law (an area of law that knows no borders), education to be continued in other courses.  
Even though I will try to make the course as structured as possible, several topics are strongly interconnected. Therefore, the conversation/discussion might flow in unexpected ways, which I fully welcome and encourage.

"Developments in neuroscience and the psychological study of cognition and emotion are transforming our understanding of the mind. These developments have large implications for law and lawyering. They challenge some of civil and criminal law's central premises - about people's rationality, free choice, and consistency over time. This course will examine some of these challenges, and it will weigh the law’s possible responses. Legal topics to be explored will include health and safety regulation, the idea of the reasonable person, intent and culpability, mental disability, and the roles of revenge, regret, and other motives in civil and criminal justice. Other themes, relevant to lawyering and to the management of conflict, will include the psychology of negotiation, the nature of intuition and judgment, and the roles of trust and social norms.

"Making an Exoneree is a project-based practicum that will involve students in wrongful conviction cases and provide them with experience, knowledge and analytical skills in working with wrongfully-convicted individuals and exploring avenues towards exoneration. The percentage of wrongfully convicted persons is currently estimated to be between 2 and 5%, meaning somewhere between 46,000 and 230,000 innocent persons are currently incarcerated. This practicum will explore the causes behind wrongful convictions and involve law students directly in the complex legal process of building a case in support of, and advocating for, an exoneration (most often, long after the original underlying conviction) on behalf of several wrongfully convicted individuals. 
Making and Exoneree was created by Marc Howard and Marty Tankleff, who share a unique connection and history: childhood friends since the age of three, they know about wrongful convictions through personal experience – Tankleff spent over 17 years in prison for a crime he did not commit, and Howard played a role in securing his exoneration. Every spring semester since 2018, under the guidance of Howard and Tankleff, fifteen highly motivated Georgetown University undergraduate students reinvestigate five probable wrongful conviction cases, produce short documentaries, and create social media campaigns, websites, and petitions advocating for exoneration. 
Law students will play an instrumental role in reviewing, analyzing and synthesizing their assigned individual’s legal case materials. They will document the procedural history of the case, perform legal research, synthesize complex case materials and legal precedent and otherwise participate in developing, assessing and advocating for different legal and related strategies that might lead to exoneration. They will contribute to identifying areas for reinvestigation, managing teams of undergraduate students doing reinvestigation, and preparing and presenting (orally and in writing) an in-depth, critical legal evaluation of their assigned case. In some cases, law students will assist legal counsel. In others, they will contribute to developing visual media, presentations and social media campaigns demonstrating the merits of a case in an effort to obtain legal representation for the person whose case they have been assigned. In 2023, during the practicum's inaugural year, one of the wrongfully convicted individuals walked out of prison after 42 years, in large part, because of the zealous work of the Georgetown Law student assigned to the case.

"Constitutional law has changed quite abruptly in the past three years.  This course should be of interest to those trying to understand how the Justices justify these changes.   This seminar will use current Supreme Court cases to consider questions about constitutional interpretation.   Students will learn about the kinds of tools used in constitutional interpretation: “originalism” in practice.  We will see the focus on text and history, and consider what is left out by those modes of interpretation once thought quite legitimate legal reasoning.  This is a course in reading Supreme Court opinions, although we will also learn “critical” skills to assess the strengths and weaknesses of originalist tools of analysis.   Some of these opinions are quite long, but that is a lawyer’s job.   The professor will not provide edited versions, except in rare cases.
In the first 5 weeks of the semester, students will be taught a background in constitutional interpretation and the modern evolution of originalism, using some law review articles, but primarily Supreme Court cases. For the next 8 classes, students will debate cases now pending in the courts that involve questions of constitutional interpretation.  The professor will introduce the background law in the first class, raise critical questions about method, and the students will debate in the second class.  Students must write one 4000 word paper.

"The District of Columbia has a unique position as the seat of the United States government.  Because it is not a state, it does not have a voting representative in the U.S. Congress. It has limited powers of home rule, and did not even receive its current form of home rule until a 1973 Act of Congress. Its power remains limited even as to matters affecting entirely local interests. Indeed, Article1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution vests Congress with the power to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases over the District, and it has done so for matters ranging from budget control to marijuana sales. DC has  non-voting representatives in each Chamber of Congress who did not have a staff, offices on Capitol Hill, or budgets, and a Delegate to the House of Representative who can participate in hearings, but does not have a vote.  In some respects, DC is like a U.S. territory, and yet, unlike territories, it does not have a clearly designated path to statehood. For many reasons, the residents of the District of Columbia have repeatedly sought statehood primarily in order to have representation and to have autonomy over its own laws, budget, and constituency, and each time the effort has failed. 
At the same time, within the narrow ambit of its home rule power, DC is a vibrant, thriving city. It has overall high income levels, with DC taxes paying the highest per capita income taxes in the nation. It has a population of over 700,000 residents, most of them full-time, larger than the population of two American states, and larger than the population of at least one state when it was admitted to the Union. That DC is a “transient city” is a myth. In fact, until recently, DC had a majority-Black population, and has for over a hundred years been a center of culture and education for Black residents, nurturing institutions like Howard University and the U Street corridor.
DC has a unitary school district, its own metropolitan transit system, and its own Mayor, an elected Attorney General, a city Council, and its own court system. The DC Council is the legislative body in DC made up of 13 members – 8 Councilmembers each of whom represent one of the eight wards in the District, 4 of whom represent the city “at large”, and one Chairman. It has a unique system of sublocal governance through its Advisory Neighborhood Commissions (ANCs). It has a police department, and a National Guard, but, as we saw on January 6, the Mayor cannot call up the Guard in the same way other Governors can on their own accord. We have also seen how the police powers of DC are constrained by the relationship with federal property and federal law enforcement agencies in the district.
DC also faces challenges in developing housing and infrastructure. Because of deep disparities in income, it has been subject, in some areas, to rapid gentrification. At the same time, through its Master Plan, and by dint of the efforts of Councilmembers, the construction of affordable housing and limiting the exodus of longtime residents is a policy priority.
DC has also distinguished itself as a best practice model in two areas: its pursuit of local climate policy, including a commitment to net-zero carbon use; and its efforts to distinguish itself as a world-class city, with subnational diplomacy and networks with mayors both in the US and globally. 
In this class, we will look at the unique structure of DC government within the contexts of our our federalist system its governance structure and institutions, and some of the policy challenges it faces. We will discuss the movement for DC statehood, including its historical and justice-related underpinnings. The class is taught by Professor Chertoff, who studies state and local government, and the Honorable Brooke Pinto, a member of the DC Council, and former Assistant Attorney General for the District of Columbia. Several guest speakers are expected.   
The assessment for the class will offer students the opportunity to participate in one of two exercises: a mock hearing in the DC Council on a contemporary bill; or a mock negotiation of a Community Benefit Agreement, an agreement designed to incorporate stakeholder input in the development that is occurring so rapidly in many formerly underserved parts of the District.

"This course will explore the primary legal and policy principles surrounding the use and disclosure of personal data across the healthcare industry – the key privacy and security laws, regulations and principles that govern how the healthcare industry operates. We also will focus on the concepts surrounding the privacy of health information, and evaluate why this information should be treated differently than other personal information (if at all). We will learn through understanding the relevant legislative and regulatory provisions, and by applying a series of case/situation examples for class discussion. The overall goal of the course is to provide both an understanding of the relevant legal principles for health care privacy in general and to develop an ability to address how these issues arise in legal practice.  
This course will emphasize the primary privacy and information security principles set out in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) as a baseline framework for compliance, and will explore how these rules apply in theory and in practice. We will discuss the best approaches for overall HIPAA compliance. We also will explore emerging areas for privacy and information security, including new enforcement principles, issues related to security breaches and breach notification, and the emergence of “non-HIPAA” data as a new challenge to the privacy and data security regulatory structure (including important developments connected to the Dobbs decision and the COVID-19 pandemic). We will spend some time on issues related to privacy and medical research. We also will assess how these issues affect the business of healthcare, including a broad range of strategic and compliance issues affecting healthcare companies and others that use personal data. We will conclude with an analysis of these issues going forward – how the law and the health care system are changing and how the regulation of the privacy of personal health data can impact these developments.

"Beginning in the 20th Century, various approaches have arisen in the United States to improve access to civil justice and use the law to empower marginalized people and communities. This course critically examines the role of lawyers in these efforts. In particular, it considers what roles lawyers play to further access to justice, empower people through the law, and work alongside social movements. After exploring studies of peoples’ experiences of the justice system, we consider the function of courts in entrenching poverty and inequality, the potential and limits of technologies in increasing access to justice; and the challenges of rural access to justice. We then turn to global and national legal empowerment initiatives to consider bottom-up approaches to making legal rights and protections available to marginalized people. In the last part of the semester, we will explore the opportunities and challenges in social movement lawyering and consider the synergies and disjunctions between these lawyering practices and efforts to enhance access to justice.
Learning Outcomes: By the end of this course, we hope you will be able to:
describe and discuss the different dimensions of the access to justice crisis in the United States and the various approaches being pursued to address it;
gain an understanding of marginalized people and communities’ experiences of the justice system;
understand what role state and local court processes and procedures play in exacerbating the justice gap;

"According to a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) 2021 survey, nearly 1 in 3 adults had either a substance use disorder or a mental illness in the prior year, and 46 percent of young adults 18-25 had either a substance use disorder or a mental illness.  Due to the increased prevalence of these chronic disorders, and their nexus to the public health crisis of suicide, opioid addiction, and homelessness, it is critically important for lawyers and advocates to have a strong understanding of behavioral health law from the constitutional to local regulatory level. 
This course is a practice-based seminar that is designed to improve the students’ practical legal skills – writing, analysis, oral communication, issue spotting, and attention to detail – while examining key laws, legal decisions, and policies in Addiction and Mental Health Law.  This seminar will explore the framework of laws and policies promoting human rights, dignity, and recovery for people with substance use disorders and mental health conditions. It will highlight systemic and community responses to addiction, mental health, and related social issues as well as the use of litigation, legislation, advocacy, grants and financial incentives as tools for prevention and reform.
Discussions will include: 
Institution-based issues such as the involuntary detention and civil commitments of individuals with a serious mental illness, restraint and seclusion, the right to appropriate treatment under Youngberg v. Romeo, institutional reform under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Monell v.

Forensic issues such as pretrial competency, Not Guilty By Reason of Insanity, and forced medication for competency purposes under Sell v. United States;
Community-based issues such as deinstitutionalization, rights of an individual to receive services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs, housing discrimination, Medicaid, rulemaking and administrative adjudications under the Administrative Procedure Act, behavioral health provider licensure and regulation, and the False Claims Act; 
Federal and state/local initiatives such as 911 diversion programs and co-responder law enforcement teams, mental health courts and diversion, harm reduction strategies, e.g. decriminalization of fentanyl testing paraphernalia, federal State Opioid Response grants, rapid rehousing initiations, and liberalization of 42 CFR Part 2 to facilitate increased information sharing for Substance Use Disorder treatment records;

"This course is designed to introduce you to the core institutions and processes of the modern administrative state.  You will come to understand the tremendous power exercised by administrative agencies as well as the significant constraints under which they operate.  You will learn the procedures governing the key categories of administrative action; the doctrine governing judicial review of administrative action; and non-judicial mechanisms of agency control within the Constitution’s separation-of-powers framework.
Learning Goals: By the end of the semester, you should be able to:
(1)  Identify the legal framework (statutory, constitutional, doctrinal) that applies to a particular issue of administrative action;
(2)  Apply the relevant legal framework to a given set of facts; and
(3)  Evaluate the merits of the legal framework against a variety of normative goals.
You should also (4) be conversant in contemporary debates about the administrative state and be able to articulate and justify your views.  ",LAW 025 v06,Administrative Law,,,"Note:

"Administrative law scholars have observed an increasing disconnect between the legal framework and doctrine governing agencies, on the one hand, and the way that the administrative state actually operates, on the other.  For example, administrative law tends to concern itself with external sources of control over agencies, while in fact most of the work of the administrative state takes place in day-to-day internal operations.  In this seminar, we use administrative law as a jumping off point to study a complementary set of frameworks and practices that govern and explain the operation of the administrative state: those drawn from public administration and political science.  Lawyers who understand these complementary tools will be better prepared to advise clients on their interactions with institutions in the administrative state; to work within the institutions of the administrative state themselves; and to design and reform those institutions in the first instance. 
This course is also a writing-intensive class that satisfies the Upperclass Legal Writing Requirement.  To that end, each of you will devote a considerable amount of time this semester to developing a paper proposal about a conflict, crisis, or controversy within the operations of a government institution; researching your idea in depth; and both drafting and revising a substantial paper of at least six thousand words (exclusive of footnotes) that meets the different elements of the Writing Requirement.  The last month of the semester will be devoted to workshopping these papers—that is, giving feedback to and receiving feedback from your colleagues. 
Learning goals:
By the end of the course, students will be able to describe and discuss the core insights of the texts we will read; to assess the merits of these insights; and to apply these insights to everyday situations relevant to the institutions of government in D.C. and beyond.  Students will also have written a paper of publishable quality analyzing and assessing a conflict, crisis, or controversy within the operations of a government institution using the lens of the tools we have studied.

"This course addresses the issues of race, poverty, mental illness, and other issues of fairness and equality in the criminal courts, particularly in death penalty cases. Topics include procedures for imposing the death penalty and racial disparities in capital sentencing, the impartiality and independence of elected judges in the state courts, competency for trial and other issues involving the mental health and intellectual functioning of people accused of crimes, and practices and procedures regarding clemency.
Course Goals and Learning Objectives:  Students will develop knowledge and understanding of issues regarding the imposition of the death penalty, the impartiality of judges, the treatment of people with mental disorders and intellectual disabilities in the criminal courts, and the consideration of applications for clemency. Students will engage with the views of Supreme Court justices, lower court judges, legislators, governors and commentators with regard to issues of fairness and discrimination in the state and federal governments in carrying out the death penalty since the Supreme Court allowed its resumption in 1976. The course will also address decision-making in the state courts. The overwhelming majority of cases – both criminal and civil – are decided in the state courts. In most states, judges are elected. Students will consider issues of whether judges are influenced by political considerations or have biases with regard to people of color who come before them. Students will learn the grounds for disqualification of a judge who may be biased and the law and procedures for resolving those issues. Students will also learn that the criminal courts deal with a significant number of people with serious mental disorders. Students will learn the legal standards for competency to stand trial, competency to waive appeals, and competency to be executed, as well as the procedures for deciding those issues. Students will also learn how the President of the United States and governors decide whether to commute death sentences and other severe sentences and practices regarding applications for clemency.

"Foreign Intelligence (FI) law as a field is marked by a complex statutory and regulatory framing. Increasingly, it is coming into play in ordinary Article III courts in the United States, as well as in European courts overseas. Simultaneously, new and emerging technologies present fundamental challenges to the traditional FI collection paradigms. This course, accordingly, provides students already broadly familiar with the contours of the national security infrastructure and foreign intelligence collection with the opportunity to do a deep dive with a particular eye towards ways in which technology alters threat vectors and presents new opportunities, and risks, to the foreign intelligence regime.
It begins with the constitutional framing and historical background undergirding the introduction of statutory and regulatory measures. The course then dissects the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and its expansion in 1994 to incorporate physical search and again in 1998 to include the use of pen register and trap and trace devices, as well as certain business records. The attacks of 9/11 led to additional changes, with further alterations implemented by the 2008 FISA Amendments Act. Discussion centers on targeting, querying, and minimization procedures adopted by the National Security Agency/Central Security Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and National Counterterrorism Center, as well as reports detailing use of FISA.
The course next turns to new technologies that have fundamentally shifted the type of information available to the intelligence community (IC). Special emphasis is given to technologies of import for metadata: social network analytics and algorithmic sciences. It looks at how these technologies mesh with the legal analysis, with particular attention paid to FISA sections 215 and 702.
The course then addresses Executive Order 12333, delving into the associated DoD Directives, Instructions, Manuals, and Annexes; Attorney General Guidelines; CIA Regulations and Directives; and parallel regulatory and policy documents throughout the IC. With the advent of the Internet of Things, next generation social media, 6G networks, artificial intelligence and machine learning, the landscape is about to again shift. Accordingly, the course will further address new and emerging technologies, looking at how they fit – or fail to fit – current law.
The course ends with a unit focused on doctrinal developments (specialized Article III courts, geographic Article III courts, and European tribunals), as well as Article II deliberations introduced via Executive Order in autumn 2022.",LAW 1745 v00,Advanced Foreign Intelligence Law,Limit: 16,"Prerequisite:

"This two-credit seminar is designed to help students develop the legal writing and practice skills necessary to succeed as judicial law clerks and civil litigators. Students will have an opportunity to build upon the written and oral advocacy skills learned in first-year Legal Research and Writing by using those skills in a practical setting that simulates the litigation process. Throughout the semester, each student will play the role of advocate, law clerk, and judicial decision-maker and should expect to research and write a motion to dismiss and a bench memorandum (both about a single fact pattern). Students will also learn to reflect on their own writing process, collaborate effectively, and edit their own written work and the work of their colleagues—all critical skills for lawyers to develop early in their careers. 
Class format will vary from week to week. Some classes will be seminar-style discussions, others will simulate courtroom experiences, and others will feature guest speakers. One class session will be dedicated to the clerkship application process and clerkship experience and will feature advocates who have clerked in the state and federal courts.

Through this course students can expect to develop their research and writing skills, understand how to approach cases from multiple perspectives, and learn practical strategies for navigating the real-world challenges of litigation and legal workplaces. The instructor(s) will provide individualized feedback on student writing at multiple points during the semester, and the course will integrate opportunities to revise based on that feedback.

"This seminar is an interactive workshop designed to introduce students to the theory, principles and practice of dispute systems design with the goal of training students to assume this new and creative professional role. Lawyers are increasingly being called upon to act not simply as litigators or deal-makers, but also as “process architects” for institutions, organizations and governments. In addition, they are being asked to design, tailor and manage systems to handle ""streams"" of disputes in an effective and efficient manner, such as those arising from commercial transactions, mass torts, natural disasters, government programs and restorative justice initiatives.
This course focuses on the study and practice of dispute systems design - understanding the structure and design choices made by, and the challenges presented to, organizations. This includes examination of court processes and other government or private systems for managing conflict. Dispute systems designers also develop and improve upon mediation and other alternative dispute resolution (ADR) service programs, as well as provide assessments of their appropriateness in various contexts. Knowledge and skills of dispute systems design are transferable to the emerging needs of practicing attorneys who are more and more frequently called upon as systems designers. Many lawyers, even if they never take the design initiative to lead a project, often serve as stakeholders and representatives of bar or professional associations recruited by systems designers to participate in the design process. This course also enhances the basic mediation and conflict management skills learned in other ADR related courses by application to the dispute system design framework.
Students will be expected to read, write, discuss, critique and participate in simulated exercises. After an overview of dispute systems design theory and principles, students will, through readings, discussions and exercises, study seven actual systems that reflect dispute systems design principles. Then through a series of additional hands-on role plays and simulations, students will have the opportunity to develop systems design skills and work on a mock consulting team during class. Simulations will lead students through the various stages or architecture of systems design, from taking design initiative through assessment, creating processes and systems and implementation. This course also focuses on advanced mediation and dispute systems design topics, including recent developments in neuroscience and their potential impact on dispute resolution, choice architecture and “nudge” principles, the impact of mediator orientations on program design, restorative justice practices, and transformative mediation. The practical and ethical implications of systems design work will also be explored, as well as opportunities for synthesis of systems design skills into legal practice.
The course meets over two weekends (Friday afternoon through Sunday). Due to the intensive and interactive nature of the seminar, attendance at all class sessions is mandatory. Grades will be based on class participation including teamwork, discussions and simulations (25%), the quality of a 6-page journal analyzing a class consulting team simulation and applying dispute systems design principles (25%), and a 14-page client proposal on a topic of the student's choice (revising a current system or designing a new system to resolve disputes) which demonstrates application and mastery of dispute systems design knowledge and skills (50%).

"In a significant minority of public corporations, a single person or entity has the power to choose the directors of the corporation and determine the outcome of stockholder votes. Many private corporations operate with this governance profile. Corporations fitting this profile are described as “controlled.”
In the standard model of the corporation, the power to direct and oversee the business and affairs of the entity rests with the board of directors, who are obligated as fiduciaries to act in the best interests of the company and its stockholders. When a party other than the board of directors has the ability to control the corporation, it upsets the standard model, with knock-on effects for a variety of corporate doctrines.
This course examines the nature of control and its implications. In addition to covering these issues in the context of public companies, the course will examine their implications for privately held companies and touch on their application to alternative entities.
Course enrollment is limited to 32. Students are expected to possess a basic understanding of the law applicable to alternative entities and corporations. An introductory course in corporations or business associations is a prerequisite.
Learning Objectives:
After taking this course, students will understand the following topics:
What constitutes control? What are the different types of control and what factors contribute to its existence?
What fiduciary duties do controllers owe? When and why do they arise?
How does the presence of a controller affect corporate doctrines such as the standard of review, demand futility, and ratification?
What devices can be used to mitigate the effects of control, such as special committees, majority-of-the-minority votes, and enhanced-independence directors?
What are the implications of particular methods of maintaining control, with particularly emphasis on the currently trending device of dual class stock?",LAW 1534 v00,Advanced Topics in Corporate Law: Control and Its Implications,Limit: Varies by section,"Prerequisite:

"This course will explore corporate litigation in the Court of Chancery in the context of mergers, acquisitions, and other transactional structures.
The course is divided into three parts. Part I will begin with a discussion of Delaware’s place in the world of corporate litigation. This will include the mechanics of initiating a lawsuit to challenge a deal, together with the Court’s role in resolving preliminary and logistical issues, before turning to the substantive law governing motions for expedition and motions for preliminary or permanent injunctive relief. Finally, we will discuss the section 220 actions for accessing corporate books and records.
Part II will focus on corporate litigation, in theory and in practice. We will discuss structural matters relating to where to file and who represents a class in competing lawsuits, and focus a significant amount of our time on recent changes in corporate litigation following Corwin. Then we'll turn to other key issues in stockholder derivative litigation relating to the board of directors.
In Part III, we will discuss non-stockholder M&A litigation of two categories trending in different directions on the Delaware dockets: appraisal and material adverse effect (or material adverse change) litigation.
While the class is divided into three parts, we may cover more or less than a single part on each of the three class days.
In addition to reading cases, students will be asked to read parts of briefs actually filed in Delaware corporate litigation. Selected students will be assigned to (informally) argue the briefed issues as assigned. Following in-class argument, we will discuss the outcome of the actual ligation.
By the end of this course, students will be familiar with the common issues arising in corporate transactional litigation; which actions may be brought directly and which must be pursued derivatively; which are statutory and which arise under the common law; and what current “hot” corporate litigation issues are currently being litigated in Delaware.",LAW 1521 v00,Advanced Topics in Corporate Law: Corporate Transaction Litigation in Delaware,Limit: Varies by section,"Prerequisite:

"The Appellate Courts and Advocacy Workshop combines a substantive review of key appellate litigation doctrines concerning appellate jurisdiction, standards of review, issue preservation, and other topics, with a significant advocacy component, including motion and brief writing. The course considers each stage of the appellate litigation process beginning with a general overview, moving to the various bases for appellate jurisdiction in the federal courts, then discussing standards and scope of review, and concluding with drafting a full appellate brief in a simulated case. (Students enrolled in the Appellate Courts Immersion Clinic, who must enroll in this course for two credits, do not draft the simulated appellate brief.) We will also briefly consider U.S. Supreme Court practice. The workload is steady and at times fairly demanding. Students desiring to get the most from this course will have to read the materials as they are assigned and complete the writing assignments diligently. In the first two-thirds of the workshop, students gain invaluable practice experience by deconstructing an appellate brief element by element and then, toward the end of the course, build on that experience by drafting a full appellate brief from scratch.
The course's half dozen small- to medium-sized writing assignments serve two purposes: They introduce students to an aspect of appellate practice, and they demand application of one or more of the course’s doctrinal topics. For all assignments, students are provided copies of relevant practice rules, statutes, cases, and other items. No outside research is required.
For a detailed course description and syllabus, please contact the instructor at (wolfmanb@georgetown.edu).
The learning goals of this course are (1) mastery of the basic doctrine of the law of federal appellate courts (in particular, jurisdiction, standards of review, and scope of review); (2)  providing students with a critical understanding of the doctrine enabling them to make credible arguments about the doctrine’s gaps and ambiguities; and (3) enhancing students’ persuasive writing skills.

"This two-credit course provides students with an appreciation of the legal, ethical, and technical issues raised by the proliferation of artificial intelligence in the field of national security. The focus of the course is to enable students as lawyers, leaders, and policymakers to grapple with these issues by giving them an understanding of how artificial intelligence operates; its potential and likely use in different national security settings; and how each use raises distinctive legal and ethical questions involving predictability, trustworthiness, responsibility, and accountability. The course will use examples and case studies to illustrate these issues, as well as videos to depict some of the technical aspects of artificial intelligence.
The specific learning objectives for the course are for students to understand the following:
(1) How artificial intelligence operates, including the concept of an algorithm, how it is trained on data, the statistical models that underlie this training and the basis for its outputs, machine learning, deep learning and neural networks, and the ways in which human choices and interactions shape this process. No technical background in statistics or computer science is necessary, since the goal is to explain these concepts in accessible terms.
(2)  Artificial intelligence as a system involving human-machine teaming, the roles that each member of the team potentially plays at different points in the process, and the concept of trustworthy artificial intelligence.
(3) The role that artificial intelligence is playing in the national security field, its capabilities and potential applications to specific areas, and the extent to which global competition to employ and refine artificial intelligence is itself a national security issue.
(4) Limitations and risks of artificial intelligence, and possible ways to address them.

"In a project-based practicum course, students participate in a weekly seminar and work on a project under the supervision of their professor. This project-based practicum course will focus on bankruptcy litigation. Students will participate in a two hour/week seminar and carry out 10 hours/week of project work under the direction of the course professor.
SEMINAR: The basic goal of this practicum is to provide law students with the opportunity to learn and then to apply litigation skills at both the trial court (bankruptcy court) level, as well as the appellate level. More broadly, the practicum will seek to demonstrate the centrality and significance of the bankruptcy law system in the context of our credit-based economy. Key themes will be evaluated including the tension between providing debtors with a fresh start and the need to provide creditors with protection of property rights. The impact of bankruptcy law will be examined at both the individual level in various contexts, such as the importance of a discharge action, as well as the broader macro level in discussions about the impact on credit cost and credit availability. Students should finish the course with a deeper appreciation of the litigation skills required to either try a bankruptcy case or to appeal from an adverse ruling, as well as the underlying goals and policies of bankruptcy law, and the impact on individuals and businesses.
PROJECT WORK: In Spring 2023, this practicum will seek to give students an opportunity to assist in the writing of an actual amicus curiae brief to be filed in a pending matter before the U.S. Supreme Court, or one of the Circuit Courts. The topic typically includes a matter of national importance in the area of consumer bankruptcy law.
The students may be able to attend the moot court for counsel for one of the parties, and, depending on the Court's schedule, the actual oral argument.
The student work will be consistent with the District of Columbia’s rule on the unauthorized practice of law (Rule 49) which makes it impermissible for students to practice law to present themselves as attorneys in any way.",LAW 1316 v00,Bankruptcy Advocacy (Project-Based Practicum),Limit: 12,"Prerequisite:

"A common complaint of recent law school graduates is that they wish they had been exposed in law school to business frameworks and skills that could help them succeed in corporate law and in business overall. Similarly, business people feel that recent law school graduates too often have little understanding of the language, thought processes and skills necessary to practice business law effectively. In today’s business environment, brutal competition and rapid disruptive change is the norm. The accelerating pace of change – fueled by global competition and technological innovation – is widening this knowledge and experience gap between businesspeople and recent law school graduates. This course attempts to bridge that gap by exposing law students to the essential business skills and frameworks needed for understanding and advising future clients who run private sector companies, government agencies, or non-profit entities. It will also expose students to the managerial aspects of running a law firm or any business. 
This course is focused on providing a basic understanding of theory and skills in areas of general management, leadership, strategic thinking, sales, marketing, finance, operations, technology, entrepreneurship, negotiations, and personal career management. Unlike the typical law school course, the reading materials for this course will focus primarily on business case studies, with each student being asked to analyze what he or she would do if faced with the business problem presented in the reading. Students should prepare to be actively engaged in each class discussion. In addition to active, ongoing participation, students will be evaluated on several short writing assignments (i.e., 2-3 page papers analyzing selected case studies); their performance in an in-class group presentation, and a final paper.",LAW 1372 v00,Business Essentials: A Mini-MBA for Lawyers,Limit: 25,,"Note:

"Over the last 200 years, free market capitalism has proven itself as an unmatched engine for driving economic growth in the United States and around the world, resulting in unparalleled innovation, improving standards of living, and vastly lengthening the average life span. Yet big problems persist, including uneven economic opportunities, degradation of natural resources, and continuation of corporate scandals. Considering these problems as pressures on democratic capitalism, the course will evaluate the relationship between business and society. The course will focus on potential approaches to managing the tensions and trade-offs that present themselves when both economic vitality (growth, innovation) and system stability (fairness, sustainability, societal needs met) are desired outcomes.
Learning Objectives:
This course will explore potential approaches to reconciling the benefits of free market capitalism with the values and expectations of a democratic society. This seminar will raise important questions and highlight issues that are relevant to a number of potential law graduate career paths including that of in-house counsel, external counsel, senior management team member, corporate board member, and policymaker & staff. To that end, students taking the course will develop an understanding of:
The evolution of views on the purpose of business in society (assumptions and realities of corporate governance)
The current problems putting pressure on democratic capitalism (externalities, regulation or lack thereof)
Emerging theories to address the inherent tensions in the system (new structures, governance priorities, industry self-regulation)

"Over the past forty years, China has gone from one of the most isolated countries in the world to a major player in international affairs, a leading exporter, and a much more influential voice on regional security matters. Yet even with the rapid economic growth and increased influence that China has achieved over the past several decades, it maintains an ambivalent attitude towards many key aspects of international law and the architecture of global order. This class will explore China’s ambivalent engagement with international law in the context of its increasing prominence as an emerging power, and will in particular look to address the question of how China might adapt to the existing world order, and the ways in which it might look to influence its evolution. The class will cover a range of issues, including China’s membership in the WTO; its engagement with the international human rights regime; China’s approach to international cooperation on issues like global warming and nuclear non-proliferation; and international law aspects of the dispute over the South China Sea; among others.
Learning Objectives:
This class will provide you with a solid understanding of China’s approach to key international law issues, and also a sense of the Chinese government’s views on international law and international legal institutions more generally. By the end of the semester, you should have a sense of how China fits into the existing global legal order, and the ways in which it is seeking to influence or even alter it. In-class discussions will also bring out the ways in which other states have sought to influence Chinese behavior, which will give you a sense of how and when relatively powerful states like China can be convinced to alter their approach to key international law issues.
For students who have not previously taken a class on public international law, this course will serve as a basic introduction to key concepts of international law (although the readings will focus very heavily on the Chinese approach, rather than the underlying law itself); for those who have taken prior international law courses, this course will serve as a useful refresher.
A core goal of the class is to understand international law from the perspective of the Chinese state. In other words, students will develop a sense of why China makes the choices it does on key international law issues, and what values and political and historical dynamics drive its decision-making. In so doing, students will gain insight into a different political-legal culture, and seek to understand how different political-legal systems – including non-democratic ones like China – come to grips with legal questions in ways that may differ markedly from the approach of the U.S. government. At the same time, having taken steps to articulate China’s perspective, students may be able to see more clearly the values and political and historical factors that drive American decisions on key international law issues.
Finally, a core goal of the response papers – above and beyond demonstrating an understanding of the substance of the readings – will be to give students the chance to build their skills at analyzing legal arguments, and in building their own written arguments in response to them. As noted below, response papers will be graded both on the basis of demonstrated mastery of the material, and also on the basis of the successful construction of a persuasive and fact-based argument.",LAW 1529 v00,China and International Law,Limit: Varies by section,,"Note:

"This year-long seminar will take the students through the entire course of a civil trial. In the first semester, using a core model case, students will conduct initial interviews of the clients, analyze the facts, and make initial decisions about how to proceed. Then, using the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, students will prepare discovery plans and conduct discovery (including drafting document requests, interrogatories, and requests for admission, and preparing for and taking depositions of lay and expert witnesses). Each student will be video-recorded taking depositions. Students will also draft and argue motions arising from discovery disputes.
The second semester will carry the core model case to trial. The seminar includes mock trial experiences, as well as class discussion of trial techniques, strategy, tactics, and ethics. Students will participate directly in a series of trial practice exercises as attorneys. These exercises will include opening statements and closing arguments, direct and cross examinations, handling exhibits, expert testimony, and making and opposing objections. Again, significant role-playing will be video-recorded.

"This course will survey the historical, current, and prospective legal and regulatory treatment of communications services, devices, service providers, and platforms. We will examine legal and regulatory issues regarding telecommunications services, mobile communications, broadcasting, cable, and broadband networks. The emphasis will be on the rules, policies, and processes of the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), but we will also discuss the roles of Congress, courts, the Executive branch, states, and localities.

The course also emphasizes the current use of the comparative method in both public and private law by legal actors such as lawyers, judges, and legislators.

It also shows how international and transnational laws address some of the differences between the two systems.

Special attention is devoted to the link between private law and the Single Market, but also to the cultural and linguistic obstacles that come up in the process of harmonization of national laws in Europe.

"This project-based practicum course will give students the unique opportunity to be part of the constitutional litigation work of Georgetown Law’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection (ICAP). Led by attorneys with deep experience in trial and appellate advocacy, national security law, and federal prosecution, ICAP pursues strategic litigation in federal and state courts at all levels to defend constitutional rights and values while working to restore confidence in the integrity of our governmental institutions.  Recent work includes safeguarding rights to free expression, assembly, and democratic participation; combating threats from unlawful private militias and political violence; fighting the criminalization of poverty and other forms of criminal legal system overreach; defending the rights of young people and marginalized communities; and preserving fundamental separation-of-powers principles. ICAP often works in close partnership with non-profit organizations, pro bono teams of law firms, and law school clinics. Students will participate in a two-hour weekly seminar and carry out an average of 15 hours per week of work with ICAP and its partners on strategic litigation and litigation-adjacent policy development.
SEMINAR: Drawing on experience from ICAP’s cases as well as prominent historical and current examples of impact litigation, the seminar will focus on the history of public and social justice litigation and its uses, criticisms, and obstacles. Seminar participants will discuss with the practicum’s Professors and other lawyers on the ICAP team strategies for bringing impact litigation, including identifying and selecting plaintiffs, test cases, venues, and legal theories, as well as engaging the public. Students will receive specific instruction on how to prepare research memoranda useful to litigators exploring which cases to take and which arguments to make; on what makes for successful, persuasive briefing of constitutional arguments; and on how to explain to the public, in forms such as short op-eds, the crux of key legal challenges and the stakes associated with them.
PROJECT WORK: Students will work an average of 15 hours per week on constitutional litigation and related projects handled by ICAP.  Work flow will depend on litigation deadlines and demands.  Students should not expect the workload to be even from week to week, and some weeks may require a significantly greater number of hours while others may require very few. Students’ roles may include providing litigators with memoranda conveying research on relevant legal issues; drafting portions of briefing materials; mooting oral advocates for argument; drafting press releases and/or op-eds relevant to ICAP’s litigation; and assisting with litigation-adjacent policy development. Students also may be involved in fact gathering related to ICAP’s litigation, including reviewing and analyzing publicly available data. 
Prospective students should review ICAP’s website for examples of previous work.  Examples include obtaining injunctions against unlawful private paramilitary activity by far-right extremists and militias; challenging bail practices and fines and fees that unconstitutionally discriminate against indigent defendants; representing “sanctuary cities” against challenges to their policies; obtaining an injunction against anti-protest legislation designed to chill First Amendment rights; and representing the U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the United States Capitol in obtaining presidential records relevant to its investigation.  Students will undertake multiple projects over the course of the semester, engaging with not only the Professors, but also with ICAP’s other litigators.

"This course will focus on the optimal functioning of privately-held and U.S. publicly-listed companies, as well as on the duties of directors and their advisors in times of crisis or significant change for the corporation.  At the conclusion of this seminar, you will have navigated multiple real-life crises that the largest public and private companies face in the course of their business, and will be equipped to play a significant advisor role to corporate boards or other stakeholders requiring commercially-savvy legal representation in corporate crises.  These are the matters that involve the country’s most experienced and capable corporate boards, advised by the best-in-class law firms, investment banking firms, public relations firms, and consulting firms, among other advisors.  Over the course of the semester, the class will analyze eight case studies for public and private companies facing a material, and in some cases, company-threatening crisis.  The course will immerse students in the most commonly recurring disruptive events that cause trauma to private and public companies.  Those disruptive events include commercial failure of the company, allegations of fraud, antitrust inquiries, activist aggression, SEC investigations, DOJ or federal or state Attorney General investigations, senior executive failures or departures, public relations crises, company-threatening civil or criminal litigation, political interference, competitive displacement, and the other most frequently-recurring fact patterns.  We will first identify and analyze the legal issues that frame the viable legal options, and then identify and evaluate the commercial interests of the company.  Within that legal and commercial framing, we will analyze the self-interests, objectives, and risk-reward calculus that drive each stakeholder’s likely decisions and actions.  
We will then role play the response plan to address the crisis, with each student playing a different role – some students will constitute the corporate board, both management and independent directors, some will role play the largest public or private shareholders, one or more will be the company’s founder(s) where relevant, and the remaining students will be the lawyers representing these and other relevant stakeholders. The seminar will focus on mastery of the legal and commercial framework that frames the viable decision trees, as well as mastery of the skills and considerations necessary to navigate the dynamics and multi-dimension nature of corporate crises. This course will also focus on the fundamental record-establishing legal documents that reflect corporate board decision-making through crises, including the preparation of presentations, agendas, resolutions, minutes, and other legal, business, and strategy documents for boards and board committees. 
Professor Green will provide case studies a week in advance along with the roles each student will play.  The students will then use the week leading up to each class to conduct legal and other research, to communicate amongst themselves, with other classmates, and with external stakeholders and shareholders. The Chair/CEO will present the facts of each case and run the board meeting with the assistance of the General Counsel, the CFO, and other stakeholders.  Professor Green will lead follow-up sessions to discuss and critique each management team’s presentation and materials and the performance of the students assuming each role.  
In addition to prepared case studies, Professor Green will provide reading materials taken from the Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times, the Economist, and the other leading business-focused media reporting on current real-life corporate crises.  We will discuss and analyze the circumstances attendant to on-going public corporate events, and will apply what we are learning in our simulations to what is likely unfolding in the boardroom in these actual situations.  Students will learn the legal and commercial framing of these scenarios and will gain insight into what is likely happening behind the scenes to manage each reported crises we study.  
In addition to the case studies, we will spend several classes reviewing and discussing the reading materials and will have panel discussions as well, including guest panelists who are expert lawyers and senior executives at companies who have worked through significant corporate crises.

"The modern economy is dominated by corporations. When the activity of those corporations results in harm – whether through the promotion and sale of unsafe products, corruption and bribery of government officials, misrepresentations about financial affairs, the uncontrolled release of toxic chemicals or pollutants, or as a result of industrial accidents -- governments increasingly look to apply criminal sanctions to the corporations and corporate executives. But the bases, purposes, and proper application of corporate criminal liability have been insufficiently studied, theorized, and appreciated, and while many find the notion of corporations having rights difficult to accept, the corporate criminal law in the US is premised on the idea that they have obligations above and beyond those held by their officers and employees.

"This course will provide students with a foundation in the financial and legal aspects of a business’ capital structure. It is designed to put students in a position to collaborate on and communicate regarding corporate finance matters with clients and other stakeholders such as bankers, investors and regulators. The course covers many of the subjects included in a business school finance class (e.g. discounted present value, valuation of risk, financial statement analysis, the capital asset pricing model and, most importantly, business valuation), while emphasizing the legal aspects of the capital structure, including the contractual and statutory regimes governing preferred and common equity, bonds, loans and other debt instruments and convertible securities. Other financing instruments will also be considered including leases, derivatives and structured products.  The course concludes with the application of corporate finance principles in contexts such as investment funds, mergers and acquisitions and financial restructurings.

An understanding of how businesses raise capital, how they make investment decisions and how they return capital to their investors and the role of lawyers in these activities.
An understanding of the theory and methods used to value projects and enterprises, including both extrinsic and intrinsic approaches.
An appreciation of the varying perspectives of clients, finance professionals, accountants and lawyers in approaching a business’ capital structure.

"Every day, corporations must assess the legal consequences of many fearsome possibilities. Some involve garden-variety business risk: Will a bank’s trading desk make a big bet that goes wrong? Others involve major changes to the business environment: Are the company’s assets particularly vulnerable to harm due to cyberattacks or climate change? And some deal with the company’s own legal compliance: Will employees lose their way and engage in illegal business? In this course, we will take a detailed look at the role of law and lawyers in governing these risks.
The course will take a dual approach to understanding the role of lawyers in corporate governance, risk management, and compliance. First, we will look at the history, corporate-law doctrines, and regulatory structures that have greatly raised the importance of these so-called “GRC” processes in recent years. Second, we will take a hands-on approach to assessing challenges to lawyers serving in GRC roles within regulated businesses, at outside law firms, and at regulatory agencies. The work of the seminar will include short presentations and case-study simulations.
Although the legal frameworks that we will consider will be U.S.-focused, the course will also explore the global nature of governance, risk management, and compliance as a legal and corporate phenomenon.

"In fieldwork practicum courses, students participate in weekly seminars and perform fieldwork at outside organizations. This fieldwork practicum course will provide students with an appreciation of the work that lawyers do in corporate and non-profit organization legal departments. Students will participate in a two hour/week seminar and do approximately 10 hours of fieldwork each week in the legal department of a corporation or association in the Washington, D.C. area. Past sponsors have included one of the nation's largest banks, a multinational information technology corporation, major software companies, an international manufacturing company, a public utility, a power generator, charitable corporations, internet start-ups, and major trade associations.
SEMINAR: The two-credit, graded, seminar portion of the practicum will focus on the competencies that lawyers need to be successful in corporate legal departments, how corporate clients make use of the work of their lawyers, how business considerations shape the work that lawyers perform, and the major legal issues with which various companies must contend. The seminar also will prompt students to develop sensitivity to the constituencies outside the corporation on which a company’s activities may have an impact. Classes will include discussion of assigned readings, problem-solving exercises, and discussions of students’ placement experiences. Students will be assigned a mid-term paper on a subject relating to in-house law department practice, and will make a presentation at the end of the semester on a topic of their choosing that relates to the student’s fieldwork and/or areas discussed during the seminary portion of the course. Grades will be based on class participation, the mid-term paper, and the final presentation.
FIELDWORK: In the two-credit, mandatory pass-fail, fieldwork portion of the practicum, students will work under supervision for approximately 10 hours each week in the legal department of a corporation in the Washington, D.C. area. Please note that due to the nature of the work, some periods will be busier than others and there may be times when students will need to work more than 10 hours in a given week.
Students will be responsible for paying their own transportation to/from their fieldwork location.
Learning Objectives:
This practicum is designed to teach the practical skills needed by lawyers practicing in the general counsel’s office of an organization. While such a lawyer will rely on training received in law school that is applicable to lawyers wherever they may practice, the role of the in-house lawyer is different from that of the private practice lawyer for a number of reasons, including that the in-house lawyer is an employee of the client, may be looked to for both legal compliance and business promotion services, will be interacting daily with numerous other employees of the organization, and may often not have the luxury of time to prepare carefully researched answers to difficult legal questions.
The course will teach the skills described in the syllabus topics through weekly seminar discussions, in-class simulations of tasks and situations facing in-house counsel, experiential learning from students’ field assignments, and in-class discussions of students’ field work experiences.",LAW 1267 v00,Corporate Legal Department Practicum (Fieldwork Practicum),Limit: 10,"Prerequisite:

"In a seminal 1970 essay, economist Milton Friedman famously wrote that a corporate executive’s responsibilities are solely to the company’s stockholders and that the stockholders’ desires are for the corporation “to make as much money as possible.”   Many credit this essay with inspiring a widely held notion that a corporation’s purpose is to make money for its stockholders without considering the interests of the greater society.  Others, including some investors, have argued that corporations should be evaluated on issues beyond their financial performance, and in recent years many of these issues have been grouped under the acronym “ESG,” standing for a corporation’s environmental, social and governance practices. Conditions and events such as climate change, the pandemic, the BLM movement, voting legislation and growing economic inequality have heightened ESG awareness.  Notable business groups, academics and others have explicitly or implicitly rejected the Friedman position and have argued that corporations have significant ESG-related obligations.
This seminar will consider issues related to the purpose of a corporation and its obligations to its stockholders and the larger group of stakeholders, the fiduciary duties of corporate directors in the context of ESG, agency issues associated with differing interests of stockholders and management, the role of the SEC and other regulators in corporate ESG matters, considerations of investors focused on ESG issues and their ability to influence corporate ESG actions, reporting of ESG-related information by companies and ratings of companies on the basis of that information and the impact of ESG considerations on corporate performance and profitability.  We will also consider particular ESG issues and how corporations have addressed them. There is no textbook for the seminar.  Readings will include legal, academic and general articles and materials on the subjects being covered.
Course Goals/Student Learning Outcomes: 
The primary objectives of this course are for students to develop an understanding of the often-conflicting considerations that affect a corporation’s handling of ESG issues and the perspectives of investors who make investment decisions on the basis of ESG considerations. This will include an understanding of state corporate law fiduciary considerations, the application of federal securities, labor, banking and other laws to ESG activities and the impact of corporate governance principles.   Students completing the course should be in a position to advise clients and colleagues on these considerations.",LAW 1747 v00,"Corporate Purpose and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Issues Seminar",Limit: Varies by section,,"Note:

"This course focuses on the federal tax treatment of transactions between a corporation and its shareholders, as well as the tax treatment of mergers, acquisitions, and other corporate reorganizations. Corporate tax rules play a major role in the structuring of most major corporate transactions, as well as the everyday practice of corporations, so an understanding of these (often quite complex) rules are essential not just to tax practice but to corporate practice generally. Students in this class are exposed to these rules, as well as some of the many creative ways corporations (and their lawyers) have structured their affairs to get the most beneficial tax treatment available. While the focus is on the traditional corporate form, it is contrasted with alternate forms of business operation, especially partnerships and subchapter S corporations.

"In 2017 the United States enacted a historic tax reform package that represents the most significant change to the U.S. international tax regime since 1986. Four years later, at the multilateral level, world leaders agreed to a fundamental reform of the international tax system involving a global minimum corporate tax.  Then in 2022 the United States did not follow through on implementing that agreement, leaving the question of whether the U.S. will implement the global minimum tax to 2025, when various provisions of the 2017 act phase out. 
  This course will study current developments in US and multilateral international tax policy. We will consider the major international tax questions at stake in Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 of the OECD project as well as the legislative questions at issue for corporate taxation in the United States in 2025, and the relationship between the negotiations at the OECD and U.S. international tax policy developments. We will also speak with government representatives involved in crafting legislative proposals and negotiating multilaterally.
  Students will write short papers with respect to the primary materials we examine, and write a final paper reflecting on the strengths and weaknesses (or lack thereof) of the new international tax regime, or particular statutory and regulatory provisions therein of students’ choosing.

"This one-credit pass/fail Week One course will introduce relevant cybersecurity legal obligations by simulating a variety of real-life cyber threats. Students will learn about the complex legal considerations related to cyber incidents, including the various stakeholders in a cyber incident, the overarching legal frameworks, and the risk landscape that shapes incident response. Students will daily apply these legal considerations in fast-paced, intense scenarios. 
This introductory course will provide an overview of the legal and ethical obligations applicable to all lawyers, as well as a foundation for upper-level cybersecurity and privacy courses. The course will include a daily substantive lecture and related simulation(s). The course will begin with simpler scenarios and build in complexity throughout the week. By the end of the course, the simulations will involve each student individually representing a different stakeholder with different priorities and objectives, each characterizing the complex landscape of considerations that influence how a cyber-incident response could play out. Students will taste what it feels like to be a lawyer working day-to-day in cyber-incident response—the messiness, the uncertainty, the high stakes, and the fun of working under such conditions. 
The goals/student learning objectives for this course include:
1. Experience a variety of cybersecurity incidents and the corresponding legal decision-making processes associated with responding to such incidents. 
2. Develop and sharpen lawyering skills, to include applying legal requirements in the face of uncertain and evolving facts, communicating complex legal issues orally with non-lawyers (e.g., with board members), and drafting documents in compliance with statutory requirements while keeping business and legal risk considerations in mind. 
3. Gain knowledge of cybersecurity law, including statutory and regulatory obligations, government relations, and cyber-incident management. 
4. Engage in effective problem-solving and prioritization of obligations related to cyber-incident response when faced with ambiguous information and tight deadlines.

"This is a project-based practicum that will involve students in ongoing death penalty cases and teach them the legal framework for death penalty litigation. Professor Sloan has been active in death penalty litigation and representation, including two recent Supreme Court victories on behalf of a death row inmate in Texas: Moore v. Texas, 137 S. Ct. 1039 (2017) and Moore v. Texas, 139 S. Ct. 666 (2019).

"Derivatives, including virtual currencies, are a large, dynamic and rapidly evolving part of the world's financial markets.

"As any judge who has served on a busy trial court can attest, there are many assignments where the cases come at you so hard and fast that there is barely time to step into the box and take your stance before the next one comes zooming in. And that is true of the “easy” cases. In addition, there are cases where the judge has to wrestle with a problem so complex, or so emotionally draining, as to test the fortitude and impartiality of even the most competent and experienced jurists. These might be called “go to the mountain top” cases.
In busy trial courts, “mountain top” cases can appear in the garb of criminal, civil, probate, or family cases. Often the judge is unable to find any guiding legal precedent and is forced to navigate uncharted waters in search of the “just” result. Sometimes controlling legal precedent exists, but following it will lead to an unjust result. And then there are cases where the judge has very wide discretion to apply a vague legal standard, like “the best interest of the child” in contested child custody proceedings, or finding the “right sentence” in a criminal case, where the statutory range might run from no prison time at all to life in prison.
Some cases are hard not only because of the subject matter, but also because they capture the attention of the entire community and become highly politicized. This can be especially challenging for elected judges, who know that whatever decision they make may become the fodder for an opposition campaign when they next stand for election, and may ultimately cost them their judgeship. These political realities do not lessen the judge’s duty to decide each case in accordance with the facts and the rule of law, by reference to neutral principles. But these requirements can make the exercise of that duty more agonizing, knowing that the decision is likely to be unpopular with at least one large segment of the population.
This seminar will provide students with a ring side seat in the arena of judicial decision-making. Students will not only have the benefit of reading 13 trial judges' stories, but they will also have the opportunity to dialogue with each author who will appear in the class that focuses on her/his story.
Learning Objectives:
By analyzing thirteen poignant stories written by trial judges who struggled with difficult cases, seminar participants should come away with valuable insights about the litigation process and the art of judging. Hopefully too, students will become enthused and empowered to become effective trial advocates and perhaps judges. Besides reading 13 stories written by judges about real life difficult cases, each student will select a judge and interview that jurist about his or her decision making process in a tough case or class of cases. The semester will culminate with students drafting a paper describing not only the issues requiring judicial decision, but also how the interviewed judge sets about deciding those issues.",LAW 1518 v00,Doing Justice: Trial Judges Explain How Tough Decisions Are Made,Limit: Varies by section,"Prerequisite:

"This course will address domestic violent extremism (DVE), an increasingly urgent matter of public concern that raises complex legal and policy issues.  The violence at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, was an unprecedented event.  It was, however, the culmination of several years during which domestic violent extremists increasingly organized themselves into paramilitary units, committed racially and politically motivated violence, intimidated people seeking to exercise their constitutional rights, and threatened government officials fulfilling their responsibilities.  In March 2021 the Office of the Director of National Intelligence reported that the intelligence community:
assesses that domestic violent extremists (DVEs) who are motivated by a range of ideologies and galvanized by recent political and societal events in the United States pose an elevated threat to the Homeland in 2021. Enduring DVE motivations pertaining to biases against minority populations and perceived government overreach will almost certainly continue to drive DVE radicalization and mobilization to violence.
In June 2021 the White House issued its Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism, recognizing the significance of the threat and the need for a comprehensive approach focused on information sharing, prevention, disruption and deterrence, and resilience.  In January 2022 the head of the Justice Department’s National Security Division declared that “attacks in recent years underscore the threat that domestic terrorism continues to pose to our citizens, to law enforcement officers and elected officials, and to our democratic institutions,” and announced the creation of a domestic terrorism unit at the Department.
Addressing domestic violent extremism raises a host of complex questions relating to law enforcement, national security, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, the right to petition regarding grievances, the right to bear arms, voting rights, and the appropriate scope of counterterrorism operations.  This course will introduce students to these issues, enhance their ability to engage in rigorous analysis of them, and enable them to formulate responses consistent with the rule of law and in respect of civil rights and civil liberties.  This analysis will be informed by an understanding of the history, nature, and sources of DVE, as well as the organizational and associational structures that it may take.
Assessment will be based on a paper of 3,000 words analyzing a legal or policy issue related to domestic violent extremism and proposing options for addressing it.
The learning objectives for this course are for students to:

"In a project-based practicum course, students participate in a weekly seminar and work on a project under the supervision of their professors. This project-based practicum course will focus on election law. Students will participate in a two hour/week seminar and carry out 10 hours/week of project work under the direction of the course professors.
SEMINAR: The seminar portion of this course will focus on voting rights law--including the Voting Rights Act, constitutional protections on the right to vote and redistricting law--and will also cover some related areas of law, including regulation of campaign finance. In the area of voting rights, the course will specifically examine the state of voting rights law and litigation in the wake of the 2013 Supreme Court decision in Shelby County V. Holder. The course will cover issues such as voter ID laws and other burdens on the right to vote, felon disenfranchisement, racial and partisan gerrymandering, and other voting-related topics based on current events. In the area of campaign finance, the focus will be on the law governing limits on contributions to candidates and the disclosure of funds contributed or spent to influence elections. Cases challenging these regulations as violative of the First Amendment have proliferated in the post-Citizens United world. Throughout the semester, students will be assigned several writing assignments that may include: complaints for potential federal lawsuits alleging violations of the Voting Rights Act and/or the United States Constitution; briefs or motions in pending voting rights cases; and other legal documents directly related to ongoing work in the voting rights and campaign finance fields. This practicum course will give students the opportunity, among other things to explore and weigh the governmental interests involved in voting and campaign finance restrictions against the rights those laws may infringe.
PROJECT WORK: Students in this practicum will have the opportunity to draft legal papers and/or briefs in current election law matters.

"From meme trading to cryptocurrencies to climate change disclosure, U.S. financial services regulatory issues are increasingly generating headlines. How do regulators address new and emerging issues? What happens when those issues do not fit neatly into the existing framework? This course will provide an overview and practical insights into how U.S. financial services regulation continues to evolve and adapt to address new challenges.
The course begins by describing how different pieces of the U.S. financial services regulatory framework fit together - including the roles of particular agencies and their varying missions - in order to set the stage for later classes. It will also introduce themes that will be explored throughout the course, such as tensions between investor protection and the facilitation of economic growth, and areas where there are both gaps in regulation and conflicts between regulators over who is responsible for certain products and activities.
The course is designed to make complex concepts accessible and to appeal to students new to financial services regulation, but also to be useful to those with prior coursework in securities regulation. Each segment will begin with an overview of a topic area followed by an exploration of current issues. For instance, the segment on the regulation of financial advice will begin by identifying the roles of the relevant players - including broker-dealers, investment advisers, and self-regulatory organizations - and then will delve into current debates, such as efforts to harmonize business conduct standards through Regulation Best Interest and the opportunities and dangers of app-based trading.
As another example, the segment on investment companies will first describe different types of funds - such as mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and private funds - and will then explore current issues such as the emergence of ESG investing and the exposure of individual investors to exotic types of assets and strategies.
The course will similarly explore other topics including:  struggles to regulate cryptocurrencies and digital assets; similarities, differences, and tensions between securities and futures regulation; debates over how to expand private offerings while protecting Main Street investors; the financial crisis of 2008 and the failure to understand the risks created by combining asset-backed securities and derivatives; historic struggles to separate investment and commercial banking; and current efforts to protect the financial system from systemic risk, including concerns related to cybersecurity and business continuity.
As in previous iterations of this course, the professors will bring in guest speakers from government, law firms, and the financial services industry. 
Grading: The course is structured to provide maximum support to ensure that students develop familiarity with the themes and questions raised in the course. Grading is based on class participation, a short practical assignment, and a final paper. To help with class participation, the professors will assign a question to each student ahead of each class to help focus discussion. Students will also work with the professors to choose a practical assignment that implements the concepts explored in class (such as making a slide presentation or writing a 1-2 page comment letter in response to a proposed regulation).",LAW 769 v00,Emerging Issues in U.S. Financial Services Regulation,Limit: Varies by section,,"Note:

"This seminar is intended to help students become better consumers of empirical work in the law and social sciences. By the end of the semester, students should: (1) understand the basics of some common empirical methodologies; (2) see how empirical work can inform public policy; and (3) have a better sense of the limits and problems inherent in empirical work.
  Each week, we will cover one or more policy-relevant empirical papers that students will be expected to read. Students will submit a 1-2 page analysis of an assigned paper before class. Each paper will introduce students to a particular empirical methodology, or show how it might be applied in a particular policy setting.
  Topics will be drawn from a variety of areas, including criminal law, education, health, development, and labor. For example, we might study questions like: what is the impact of education on earnings? How do 401(k) plans affect people’s savings decisions? How does a change in the minimum wage affect labor supply? Do minimum drinking ages reduce drunken driving deaths? What are the benefits and limits of randomized controlled trials?

"This course will consider ethics principles governing the conduct of counsel, arbitrators and expert witnesses in international commercial and investment arbitrations. Topics will include recent developments in the IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration and the IBA Guidelines on Party Representation in International Arbitration, other soft law instruments such as the ABA/AAA Code of Ethics for Arbitrators in Commercial Disputes, national law regulation of the conduct of arbitrators and counsel in international arbitrations, ethics requirements included in international arbitration rules and ethics requirements for witnesses in international arbitrations, as well as recent ethics-related jurisprudence from ICSID, arbitral institutions and various national courts.
Learning objectives:
This course has the following goals:
To enable the student to identify fundamental differences between the ethics obligations of principal participants (arbitrators, counsel and witnesses, particularly expert witnesses) in international arbitrations (involving participants from a multiplicity of States and legal systems and a forum intended to be perceived as neutral and thus largely outside the influence of the particular national legal systems of the parties) and the ethics obligations of principal participants in national judicial systems.
To identify the complex regulatory, choice of law and legal culture problems involved in identifying the sources and content of ethics obligations of participants in international arbitrations in light of the diversity of legal and national cultures involved and to compare and contrast with the sources and content of ethics obligations of participants appearing in national courts.
To identify possible remedies for breaches by participants in international arbitrations of their ethics obligations (if any) and to compare and contrast with remedies in national courts.
My objective will be to enable students, by the end of the sessions, to be able to:
describe the subject areas covered (or not covered) by ethics responsibilities for principal participants (arbitrators, counsel and witnesses) in international arbitration
describe how those areas may differ in sources and content, when compared with national court systems,
recognize and explain reasons why the ethics responsibilities of participants in international arbitration differ from the ethics responsibilities of similar participants in national court systems
describe important uncertainties with respect to ethics obligations of those participants, and
apply that learning to advise clients and counterparties on complying with those responsibilities or, when the nature of those responsibilities are uncertain, how to manage the arbitral process in light of those uncertainties.",LAW 3009 v00,Ethics in International Arbitration,,,"Note:

"Tax harmonization within the European Union is very difficult to achieve. Most legislative measures of the European Union in this area require the consensus of all 27 member states. The only real engine of harmonization seems to be the European Court of Justice (ECJ). The ECJ itself cannot harmonize the tax systems, however, the Court can force the member states to open their tax systems for tax competition within Europe. The judgments delivered by the ECJ are most of the time very surprising, even to experts.

"In the J.D. Externship Program, students work under the supervision of a field supervisor attorney to gain substantial lawyering experience that is reasonably similar to the experience of a lawyer advising or representing a client or engaging in other lawyering tasks outside of the law school. Working in collaboration with their field supervisors, students establish individualized learning goals for their experience and receive ongoing feedback in a real-world practice setting. At the Law Center, students participate in a companion seminar to reinforce their field placement experiences. Through the seminar, students consider essential topics involving professionalism, ethics, cultural competency, professional identity, legal problem-solving, work-life balance, and the role of a lawyer. Through regular classroom engagement, students enhance their learning at the field placement and develop critical reflective practices that they will use throughout their careers.
Please refer to the J.D. Externship Program website for detailed program information.
Identifying a Placement:
Students are responsible for securing their own judicial, governmental, or nonprofit field placements. The Office of Public Interest and Community Service (OPICS) is available, by appointment, to discuss potential externship opportunities. In addition, the J.D. Externship Program has resources to help students identify an externship placement.
FIELDWORK: Students work for 11 or 16.5 hours per week for at least 10 weeks (110 or 165 hours total) in a judicial, governmental, or nonprofit field placement. Students must be supervised by a licensed attorney or an individual otherwise qualified to supervise a legal extern at the field placement. Georgetown Law defines ""an individual otherwise qualified to supervise"" as someone qualified to assign, review, and give substantive feedback on a student's legal or policy work. Students are responsible for finding their own placements. Students may be compensated for the work at their qualifying government, judicial, or nonprofit placement. Students may not work on pro bono matters at a for-profit entity. Students earn 2 pass/fail credits for 10 hours of fieldwork/week or 3 pass/fail credits for 15 hours of fieldwork/week.
Note: Students can begin working toward the hours/week requirement (110 or 165 hours total) from the first day of regular, semester-long classes. Students must complete the total hours requirement by the last business day of classes.

"This course is designed to complement the rest of the 1L curriculum in several ways.  First, it will expose you to selected elements of international and foreign law, beyond the usual concentration on the U.S. domestic law system.  Second, our focus will be principally upon treaty texts, rather than judicial decisions, within a system that does not rely upon binding precedents in the same ways you have already encountered.  Third, we hope to nurture your sensitivity to facts, as much as to law, as key elements in legal practice.  Finally, through a series of collaborative simulation exercises, we intend to engage you in active, experiential learning in a direct, powerful way.
The four-day simulation is based upon a hypothetical attempt by the United States to secure the extradition of two accused terrorists, who have been indicted in federal court for participating in terrorist acts on U.S. soil, but who are currently resident in Russia and in France.  The leaders in those countries appear willing to return the two suspects to the United States, but the effort may be blocked by those countries’ membership in the European Convention on Human Rights, which may bar extradition in cases where the accused would face the prospect of capital punishment or indefinite detention in harsh conditions.
Students will be assigned the role of counsel for one of the defendants or one of the governments, and will work in small teams on two primary tasks.  The first exercise is to prepare for and conduct a fact-gathering interview of one of the clients.  The second exercise is to plan, practice, and conduct a simulated hearing before the European Court of Human Rights.  Throughout, students will be guided by the instructor and by a team of teaching fellows in the development of essential lawyering skills, including fact development and analysis, problem solving, strategic planning, and effective oral advocacy.",LAW 611 v01,"Extradition Simulation: International Law, Human Rights, and Effective Advocacy",Limit: 24,,"Note:

Students will gain hands-on experience practicing technology advocacy. The course first reviews key issues in technology policy and advocacy, such as competition, content moderation, net neutrality, privacy, AI & bias, and cybersecurity.
Armed with the basics of current technology policy issues, students then learn advocacy tools to “make” technology policy. Students will review and draft collateral materials used for technology policy advocacy, including white papers, talking points, comments, “op/eds,” earned media coverage, and more, gaining an appreciation for the differences from, and complementary relationship with, traditional legal materials and legal practice. Students will be introduced to the legislative process (committee hearings and markups, bicameral action, budget procedure); independent agency rulemaking and adjudication (comments, ex parte presentations, Administration and congressional input); relevant enforcement proceedings (Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission merger review); and related advocacy in the courts (amicus briefs).

"This is an introductory course in federal income taxation which considers the principles and policies of the Internal Revenue Code regarding the taxation of individuals and businesses. Professor Brown's section covers the principles and policies of the Internal Revenue Code regarding the taxation of individuals.  Major topics include the definition of income, deductions and exclusions, assignment of income, accounting, and issues of timing. Emphasis is placed on the use of the Internal Revenue Code and administrative and judicial material.
Learning Goals for Professor Brown's section
That you learn how to read the Internal Revenue Code (“Code”), not memorize it, so that when the Code changes – and it will – you will be able to understand the new provision.
That you engage the material during class, not merely transcribe the words that you hear.
That you strengthen your existing critical reading skills so that you become a skeptical reader which will better prepare you for the practice of law.
That you understand basic business terms and transactions, regardless of what area of the law you ultimately will practice.  The lawyer who understands her client’s business will prove to be invaluable to the client.
That you enhance your problem-solving skills. The successful lawyer of the 21st century must figure out a way to get to yes when the easy answer is no.
That you discover the relevance of tax policy issues to everyday life.

"As an instrument of federalism, the U.S. Constitution plays a vital role in defining state and local governments’ taxing powers. In some instances this is accomplished by express Constitutional provisions; in others, by express or implied grants of authority to the legislative, executive or judicial branches of government. This advanced state and local tax course will explore and analyze Constitutional provisions that limit (and sometimes expand) state and local taxing powers. It will include a historical review of Supreme Court jurisprudence that underscores the inherent complexities and tensions precipitated by the intersection of federalism and the underlying goals embodied within the Commerce Clause, Equal Protection Clause, Import-Export Clause, Privileges and Immunities Clause, and Supremacy Clause, among others. The course also will explore how issues of federalism have shaped various Federal statutory enactments, as well as pending pieces of federal legislation. For example, it will analyze how federalist tensions and statutory dynamics were balanced in a proposed congressional bill concerning state and local tax incentives.

"The majority of civil cases involving the federal government arise from challenges to agency decisions ranging from contractor selection by government procurement officials to project approvals by both civilian and military agencies under various regulatory schemes implementing the nation’s laws, such as health, finance, and environmental laws. This class will provide students with the opportunity to learn in a variety of factual contexts how to litigate federal cases challenging agency decision-making on the administrative records prepared by agencies to support their decisions. Each class will focus on a particular stage in the litigation process. Students will be given reading and related litigation exercises that will be carried out in class. The class will culminate in filing a motion for summary judgment on the administrative record.
Over the course of this class, students will present three oral arguments to the professor, who will role-play as the presiding judge, based on briefing from real district court cases. The arguments will simulate as closely as possible real world federal court hearings. Some arguments will be recorded so that students may review their oral argument performance. Professor Jones will provide students with critique and feedback after each oral argument, with the goal of improvement by each student over time.
This class is designed for students who are interested in gaining practical experience in litigation for or against the federal government.  Through this course, you should:
Understand the basic stages of litigating federal cases involving federal agencies;
Become familiar with key administrative law concepts and how those concepts apply in a litigation setting;
Refine critical reading skills, including recognizing rules, facts, and analyses that are both helpful and harmful to your client’s interests;
Understand how crucial facts are in litigation, and how to tie those facts to a legal argument that benefits your client;
Demonstrate an ability to translate detailed arguments presented in legal briefs to clear, concise, and persuasive oral arguments before the court;
Gain experience presenting arguments orally in a formal, courtroom-like setting;
Demonstrate an ability to engage in effective legal analysis and advocacy through polished, readable, and concise written product;

"The so-called “federalism revolution” of the past 30 years, reflected in a series of controversial Supreme Court decisions, has engendered reams of commentary and provoked widespread litigation challenging a range of federal statutes under constitutional provisions including the Commerce Clause, the Spending Clause, and the Tenth and Eleventh Amendments, as well as nondelegation principles and other related doctrines.
Rarely has so complex a body of interrelated law developed so quickly. The seminar will trace the development of the Court’s recent federalism jurisprudence both from a doctrinal perspective and as a study in the dynamics of judicial decision-making. A critical aim of the course will be to understand the values underlying the federalism debate, and to observe judges and justices of all persuasions seeking to reconcile those values with other priorities and with the institutional limitations of the courts. We also will consider the extent to which the Court’s recent jurisprudence, including new limitations on the federal administrative state, has altered the dynamics of federal-state relations and whether future decisions are likely to do so.
We will use the developing nature of the federalism jurisprudence as an opportunity to develop advocacy skills. Students will satisfy the writing requirement by writing a 25-page appellate brief in one of the cutting-edge cases designated on the syllabus or comparable academic paper. We will work closely with each student in developing the structure and argument of the brief or paper, and in moving from draft to final product.

"Financial markets are political. Yet, legal education has historically relied upon an unsustainable distinction between law, politics and markets. The predominate framework for examining markets has been neoclassical economics—which put simply, suggests that the independent market forces of supply and demand driven by rational, self-serving actors, dictate market outcomes. This course offers students an alternative framework with which to interrogate financial markets. Specifically, it examines how political, technological, and socio-legal drivers have shaped consumer credit markets to be integral to the modern economy, for better or worse. Students will explore the history of consumer credit; interrogate select laws and policies (e.g., Truth in Lending Act, Community Reinvestment Act); and critically examine agencies that impact access to consumer credit (e.g., Federal Reserve, credit bureaus). In doing so, students will tap into broader debates on economic and racial justice, surveillance capitalism, and labor movements.
Learning Objectives: Throughout this course, students will:
Investigate, explain and apply normative frameworks for analyzing the relationship between law, financial markets, and the political economy.
Interrogate the use of theoretical frameworks like neoclassical economics and think critically about the supposed neutrality of law and politics in financial markets.
Examine the centrality of consumer credit in the modern economy, and consider the impact of such a political choice on differing class, gender, and racial demographics.

We will examine how virtual currencies are used by financial market participants and evaluate major developments in the regulation of virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin, Ether, Ripple, Litecoin, and others.
This course also provides a comprehensive overview of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”) and its ongoing implementation efforts by Federal financial regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act is the most consequential reform of the financial services industry since the Great Depression. We will analyze financial market reform efforts emerging regulatory issues that are intended to increase transparency in financial markets, reduce systemic risks, increase the safety and soundness of the financial system, and enhance protections for consumers. 
Learning objectives:
By the end of this course, I hope you will have a comprehensive overview of the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act. You will gain a sense of the genesis and policy developments underpinning the Dodd-Frank legislation, an overview of fundamental aspects of financial reform in Dodd-Frank, its basic requirements, its overarching goals, and its upsides and downsides. You will not learn every detail of financial services regulation or every part of Dodd-Frank, but you should grasp the nature and structure of the central tenants of federal oversight of the financial services industry and its market participants.
Another aim of the course is skills-oriented. By participating in class discussions and preparing and presenting the Comment Letter Group Project, I hope you will hone your skills in speaking fluently and comfortably about legal issues. The Comment Letter Group Project is designed to give you real-world experience/exposure to what regulatory lawyers actually do in private and government practice in the financial services space. I want students to be able to identify an issue, think critically about how to solve it, employ legal reasoning to defend their approach, and practice legal writing.

"This course is a general introduction to business bankruptcy law. Bankruptcy provides a background term for nearly all business transactions. The possibility that a counterparty may not be able to fulfill its obligations is a critical factor in shaping deals. This course reviews the fundamentals of debt contracting, including the role of events of default, covenants, representations and warranties, debt priority, and security interests. It covers private and public orderings of debt restructuring: private workouts and bankruptcy reorganizations and liquidations. Topics to be covered include the distressed debt market, exchange offers, property of the estate, the automatic stay, the avoidance of prebankruptcy transactions, the treatment of executory contracts, the debtor's governance structure during bankruptcy, asset sales, the financing of operations of bankrupt companies, the distressed debt market, the process of negotiating, voting, and confirming a plan of reorganization, and transnational and sovereign issues in bankruptcies.",LAW 545 v01,Financial Restructuring and Bankruptcy,Limit: Varies by section,,,,"Mutually Excluded Courses:

"This course is important for the aspiring tax professional who desires to better understand and communicate with business decision makers concerning the consequential effects of transactions and how they will be reflected in the financial statement disclosures or tax related accounts found in the income or balance sheet. This course is important for the person who wants to best position themselves for job opportunities with some of the single largest U.S. and global employers of tax professionals (e.g., the Big-4 accounting firms) who place a premium on LL.M. (Tax) applicants with a basic understanding of the financial statement impact of various taxable events, which are important to many of their clients and the services they provide.
This one-credit pass/fail course is comprised of four conceptual modules: the first three modules focus on income based taxes; and, the fourth, non-income based taxes. The income tax modules are designed to first explain and illustrate the financial statement accounting rules applicable to a wide range of frequently encountered taxable events; and, secondly, illustrate how the financial accounting consequences arising from those events can drive the actions of business decision makers in a direction that may appear counterintuitive from a tax perspective only. Contemporary topics facing today’s decision makers will be selected for this course, and will be explained and illustrated through assigned readings, classroom examples, and case studies.
The first of the income tax modules, Basic Accounting Concepts, will offer the uninitiated a high level overview of the conceptual cornerstones that drive most of the significant accounting questions related to taxation. Further, this first module will define and illustrate the concept of “deferred taxation”, which is the financial statement mechanism used to reconcile the differing rules governing the recognition of transactions for financial statement and tax statement purposes; and, most frequently, where the accounting differences between US GAAP and IRFS arise. Other topics explained and illustrated herein will include: permanent differences; temporary differences involving deferred tax assets, deferred tax liabilities and the impact of changing tax rates; uncertain tax positions; undistributed profits of foreign subsidiaries; net operating losses; and, related financial statement disclosures.
The second income tax module, More Advanced Accounting Concepts, will drill down on other select topics where disparate financial statement standards exist between US GAAP and IFRS. Among the topics included in this module are: share-based payments; foreign non-monetary assets and liabilities; intercompany transfers of assets remaining within the group; tax basis and intention of management for settling assets/liabilities; the “initial recognition exemption”; and, the measurement of deferred taxes when different tax rates apply to distributed and undistributed profits.",LAW 2088 v00,Financial Statement Accounting for Tax Consequences,Limit: Varies by section,"Prerequisite:

"Rules governing food and agriculture can have a dramatic impact on the welfare of farmers, food and farm workers as well as the price of food, access to healthy food, the fate of rural communities, the environment, and animal welfare. This is a fieldwork practicum course that has both 1) a two-credit graded seminar exploring food justice and policy issues and 2) a two- credit fieldwork placement. The fieldwork credits are mandatory pass-fail. 
SEMINAR: This seminar portion of the course will advance the Law Center’s institutional learning outcomes by covering the policies, rules, and laws that govern food and agriculture, including laws and regulations related to farm subsidies, farm stewardship, pesticide safety, food safety, food labeling, food and farm labor, and animal welfare. The extent to which these policies have discriminated against farmers of color and food and farm workers and limited access to healthy food choices will be a major theme of this practicum. Students will have pervasive opportunities to think critically about the law’s claim to neutrality and its differential effects on subordinated groups.
FIELDWORK: In the fieldwork component of this course, students will be assigned to projects with the Environmental Working Group, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, Earthjustice, or other food, farm, worker, environmental justice, and animal justice organizations working on these issues. They will have an opportunity to learn how such institutions play a role in advancing food justice issues being debated in both the administrative and legislative processes, and in matters subject to litigation.

"Our society’s intense polarization has had serious consequences for our campuses, in no arena more significant than freedom of expression. In today’s toxic environment, how can students and faculty, and the numerous other stakeholders, pursue liberal, rational, open learning? How can they speak up without fear? How can campus administrators ensure safety and maintain civility? What speech is protected and what speech is deemed to be hateful? What legal redress can there be for threatening speech? What are the effects on all of us of a lack of free inquiry and civility on campus?
This course seeks to answer those questions as it considers the contours of free expression on campus. We will cover the distinctions between public and private colleges and universities, religion and free expression, and the relationship among free expression, academic freedom, shared governance, and freedom of association. We will consider the limits on expression, and where behavior crosses over the line from being protected to become the proper subject of disciplinary action or removal from the institution. We will also address the way in which the boundaries of free expression are foundational to institutions of higher learning. To say that expression is protected is a threshold issue, not the end of the discussion, bringing us to a compelling topic for the nation generally, and academia particularly: the relationship between free expression and civility in the public square.
Learning Objectives:
Our goal throughout the course will be to understand the breadth of issues faced by higher education institutions in their mission to further free and open debate and discussion, and also maintain a safe and appropriate learning environment for all members of the community. We will focus on applicable legal doctrines as well as the philosophical underpinning of free inquiry and academic freedom. Whether or not students seek to serve as a University Counsel, all need to understand the laws underpinning the fundamental freedom of expression. Our campuses are the places where knowledge is created and transmitted, and therefore what happens on campus matters beyond its confines.
There is also a skill-oriented aim of this course. Students will often be in the position of the college or university’s general counsel, or other members of the administration, having to articulate the standards that apply to the institution, making or recommending decisions in particular cases, or formulate campus policy. Students taking the course for 3 credits, who will write a significant research paper, will have the opportunity to develop their skills in legal research and writing as applied to a particular issue and will present their papers at the final class meeting.",LAW 1812 v00,Free Speech on Campus: Law and Policy,Limit: Varies by section,,"Note:

"In fieldwork practicum courses, students participate in weekly seminars and conduct related fieldwork at outside organizations. This fieldwork practicum course will focus on governmental protection for persons fleeing gender-based persecution and abuse. Students will participate in a two hour/week seminar and ten hours/week of fieldwork with law firms and nonprofit organizations in the D.C. metro area to represent clients fleeing their countries due to gender-related violence.
SEMINAR: In the two-credit, graded seminar portion of the practicum, students will discuss how shifting migration patterns and societal forces have caused more women and sexual minorities to leave their home countries and immigrate to the United States. In many countries, individuals face persecution and violence on account of their gender. This includes the use of rape as a weapon of war, domestic violence, so-called honor crimes, forced marriage, widow rituals, one child policies, forced sterilization policies, and female genital mutilation. During the seminar, students will study and learn through experience about the societal forces causing the forced migration of women and sexual minorities and how U.S. laws and policies address the immigration status of these immigrants. We will focus on forms of relief that, while available to both men and women, are primarily accessed by women and members of the LGBTQ+ community to obtain legal status in the United States. Specifically, we will focus on: asylum, withholding of removal, protection under the Convention Against Torture, the Violence against Women Act, U Visas, and T Visas.
FIELDWORK: In the two-credit, mandatory pass/fail fieldwork portion of the practicum, students will work with lawyers from law firms and nonprofit agencies on real cases of immigrants fleeing their countries because of gender-based violence.

"In 1977, the United States adopted the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) to combat bribery of foreign public officials. As with many U.S.-led initiatives, it was seen at the time as naïve, quixotic, myopic, and doomed to failure. A little more than 20-years later, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) adopted its Convention on Combatting Bribery of Foreign Public Officials, and as required by the Convention, the countries of Western Europe promptly adopted organic statutes modeled, in large measure, on the FCPA.
In the ensuing decade and a half, prosecutions of corporations for foreign bribery have become perhaps the most important prosecutorial priority for the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and Securities & Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and certainly the most financially lucrative U.S. prosecution initiative. Transnational investigations have become a staple of these prosecutions. All 10 of the largest FCPA prosecutions have occurred since 2008; of these, eight have involved foreign corporations.
This course will cover the development of U.S., international, and foreign initiatives against public-official bribery. Because (at least in the US) most of these cases have been resolved without litigation, we will focus on critical, unresolved issues, such as the FCPA’s definition of a foreign “instrumentality” and a “foreign official,” as well as the scope of U.S. extra-territorial jurisdiction. In addition to addressing the substance of foreign and international laws and conventions, we will explore the critical issues that arise from the growing trend in trans-national investigations and prosecutions, including double jeopardy, res judicata, and international data collection.
We will explore these issues through fact-based, real-world scenarios drawn, in large part, from the “Bonny Island” case, which involved a scheme by four international corporations to bribe three successive Nigerian presidents (as well as a constellation of lower-ranking officials) to secure multi-billion dollar contracts for the construction of an LNG facility in Nigeria. We will use this factual setting to frame class participation and in-class exercises and projects, with the goal of sharpening critical thinking, tackling complex legal questions in concrete factual settings, and honing advocacy skills.
Learning Objectives:
We have the following expectations of learning outcomes:
We expect each student to achieve mastery of the basic concepts underlying the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, including the basic statutory terms, the elements of the various offenses, and the scope of U.S. jurisdiction. In our experience, it is impossible to fully understand and discuss more challenging questions about the scope or application of the statute without mastery of the fundamentals.
We expect each student to gain an understanding of the roles and policies of the U.S. enforcement authorities, the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the manner in which FCPA cases are investigated, prosecuted, and defended, as well as how the U.S. enforcement agencies would approach a problem and what outcomes are likely to result.
We expect each student to gain an understanding of the global enforcement landscape for anti-corruption. Students are expected to achieve a basic understanding of the OECD Convention on Bribery, other international anti-bribery conventions, and the leading state laws, including the Brazil Clean Companies Act, the UK Bribery Act, and the French Sapin II. Students will also gain an understanding of the role of the World Bank and other multi-lateral development banks in the worldwide scheme.
We expect students to learn the basic principles of anti-corruption compliance programs, and the manner in which anti-corruption compliance impacts the prevention, detection, investigation, and prosecution of FCPA cases, as well as violations of similar foreign laws.
Through scenario-based learning, we expect students to gain a facility in applying law to fact and an understanding of how governments and defense counsel approach challenging question of jurisdiction, enforcement, and punishment in a multi-jurisdictional, cross-border setting.",LAW 1298 v00,Global Anti-Corruption Seminar,Limit: Varies by section,,,,"Mutually Excluded Courses:

"This course explores the global legal and regulatory framework for futures, swaps, options, and other derivatives, with a focus on the ways that technology and innovation are changing how these markets function and are regulated. High-frequency trading (HFT) firms now use algorithmic trading robots to place trades in futures contracts and other financial instruments in fractions of a second, while the markets for futures and other derivatives are witnessing the rise of digital intermediaries – computers and software programs – that perform the role of traditional intermediaries. Likewise, blockchain technology offers the prospect of settling transactions in a manner that is fundamentally different to the financial industry’s current approach of using overlapping centralized ledgers. Students will analyze the unique challenges that the increasing use of these and similar technologies present for U.S. and international policymakers, regulators, and market participants. Students will learn the overall structure and key provisions of the US regulatory framework and policy perspectives, which will be compared and contrasted with those of other jurisdictions, such as the EU and its member countries, with an emphasis on how the statute, regulations, and precedent are addressing (or not addressing) issues brought about by technological advances, such as market manipulation by algorithmic robots.

"Globalization and the international trade of drugs and medical products have progressed beyond any single regulatory authority’s ability to effectively ensure the quality, safety, and effectiveness of these products. In the U.S., the importation of foreign sourced products has increased tremendously, accounting for over 80% of the active pharmaceutical ingredients. However, varying drug regulations have resulted in gaps in oversight causing differing views on the acceptable level of risk in public health leading to drug quality related deaths and other serious harms. One clear reason for this compromised system is the differences in how these products are regulated from country to country. Nevertheless, the pharmaceutical and related industries are thriving in the global marketplace.

"This one-credit (7 session) seminar is designed to build on the experiences of the fall 2L GLS seminar (“Building an International Skill Set”) by affording participants an opportunity to apply the specific skills used by international and transnational lawyers in the context of a specific substantive area chosen by them. For 2013/14, the 2L GLS focused on constructing an international trade mechanism to promote corporate accountability in developing countries, specifically addressing environmental and human rights concerns. For 2014/15 the 2L group wrote an assessment of corporate compliance W.R. of 1502 of Dodd Frank in the area of conflict minerals. For 2015/16, the group conducted an in-depth analysis of implementation review mechanisms (CIRMs) in multilateral agreements. In 2016/17 the chosed topic was on use of armed force in outer space. Preparation for the group sessions includes background readings on the theoretical, practical and legal aspects of the relevant issues.

"In this course, students will learn how to structure and execute global securities offerings. The course begins with a brief examination of the process of an SEC-registered offering in the U.S., and the ongoing requirements of SEC reporting companies, and then continues by examining how to conduct offerings, both domestically and internationally, outside of SEC registration. Topics include the registration requirements of 5 of the Securities Act, the various exceptions from registration, including Sections 4(a)(1), 4(a)(2) and 4(a)(7) of the Securities Act, the safe harbors pursuant to those exemptions, including Regulation S, Regulation D, Rule 144, Rule 144A, and the changes to certain of those rules and regulations by recent legislation, including the JOBS Act and the FAST Act. In addition to a thorough review of the rules and regulations in the course materials, this course seeks to give students insight into how those rules and regulations are used in practice, and into the mechanics of conducting various types of securities offerings, so that upon completing the course students are better prepared to address these topics in practice.

"Course Overview
How can lawyers advocate effectively for solutions to pressing human rights challenges?
This project-based practicum enlists students in tackling real-world human rights challenges and creates a learning environment that equips students to analyze a problem, assess the legal and policy situation, and propose and execute strategies for change.
Students in this practicum receive intensive instruction from law professors and subject matter experts on both the relevant human rights law as well as effective strategies and tactics for human rights advocacy. Professor Massimino has a distinguished record of human rights advocacy and led Human Rights First, one of the nation’s leading human rights advocacy organizations, as president and CEO before coming to Georgetown Law. Michelle Liu is an adjunct professor and has supported partner NGOs in several countries to promote women’s and children’s human rights through litigation and legislative reform. Catherine Cooper is the Dash-Muse Senior Teaching Fellow and Supervising Attorney and has supported civil society organizations in Myanmar, Iraq, and East Africa on issues including transitional justice and the rights of ethnic and religious minorities. Ashlynn Kendzior is a Supervising Attorney and Teaching Fellow and has worked on issues related to gender equity with a focus on reproductive rights. Together with their professors and fellow classmates, students collaborate on a project that supports the mission and objectives of a chosen NGO partner of the Human Rights Institute (HRI). This collaboration gives students a unique opportunity to conduct legal and factual research, craft legal solutions, and develop an advocacy campaign with real-world impact. 
For the 2023-2024 academic year, the practicum will focus on justice and accountability for victims of human rights violations in Egypt. HRI's partner is a group of organizations dedicated to holding abusers to account through innovative tactics.
The practicum is a year-long course and comprises three mandatory components: a two-hour weekly seminar, project-related teamwork performed in and outside of class, and a week-long field investigation (likely involving international travel) during Week One in January 2024. 
Seminar
The seminar portion of the practicum will cover the substantive law and legal framework as it pertains to a particular human rights issue. For the upcoming year, students will learn about the international human rights framework on arbitrary detention, torture, and other human rights abuses, as well as the international and domestic legal avenues for pursing justice and accountability. Students will also use seminar time to propose and assess what legal remedies and accountability mechanisms may be appropriate and viable to address the human rights violation. Guest speakers with subject matter expertise may be invited to seminars to hold workshops and offer critique of student work. Finally, the seminar will also be the training ground for students to develop their critical thinking, public speaking, and persuasive writing skills through the formulation of a human rights advocacy campaign.
Project Work
Students will work in teams to complete a human rights project that furthers the mission of HRI’s partner organization. Depending on the particulars of the project, students may engage in any or all of the following:
conduct fact-based research on a human rights issue,
learn about the international human rights framework pertaining to the issue,
identify the legal gaps and barriers that are impeding justice, accountability, or the realization of human rights,
assess viable remedies and solutions to addressing such legal gap or barrier,
propose changes to legislation, advocate for targeted sanctions, or draft a legal brief or policy report, and
develop a multimodal strategic campaign for human rights advocacy
Field Investigation
Students will have the opportunity to conduct project-related field investigation during Week One. Students will have mandatory full-day obligations from Monday, January 8 through Friday, January 12, 2024. The field investigation may involve international travel to interview or consult with stakeholders, human rights advocates, community leaders, lawmakers, or other relevant individuals working on the ground.  More details about the field investigation component of the course will be discussed and established in the fall semester.
Students will be required to complete the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) Program for ethical human subject research before Week One. Students must also have a valid passport with at least six months remaining from the first day of spring semester classes.
Learning Objectives
As a result of completing this practicum, students will be able to approach a human rights issue from the perspective of a legal advocate who is equipped to effect change.
Students will learn how to conduct desk research on human rights violations, as well as how to assess violations of human rights using international and regional treaties, international court jurisprudence, and other sources of law. Students will also learn how to conduct first-person interviews and/or meetings in a cross-cultural context.
Students will learn how to identify legal and political barriers that impede justice, accountability, and the realization of human rights. By working together with law professors and subject matter experts to formulate a viable, impactful, and victim-centric advocacy plan, students will develop the critical thinking and communication skills needed to become effective human rights advocates.
Credits
This is a seven-credit course. Three credits will be awarded in the fall—two for the seminar and one for the approximately five hours of project work per week, for a minimum of 11 weeks. Four credits will be awarded in the spring—one for Week One, two for the seminar, and one for the approximately five hours of project work per week, for a minimum of 11 weeks. Both the seminar portion and the project portion will be graded. The field investigation is an integral and required portion of the course. Students should consider their individual capacity to work cross-culturally with individuals who have experienced or are experiencing ongoing human rights violations. Permission to miss the Week One field-work portion of the course will be granted only in exceptional circumstances, such as a sudden illness or death in the family.",LAW 034 v10,Human Rights Advocacy in Action Practicum (Project-Based Practicum),Limit: 12,"Prerequisite:

"“Human rights” names both a body of law and a moral ideal. The French revolutionaries issued a “Declaration of the Rights of Man” and the U.S. Declaration of Independence proclaimed rights that are both self-evident and unalienable. The British jurist Jeremy Bentham replied that the idea of unalienable rights is nonsense – indeed, “nonsense on stilts.” Today we confront similar philosophical debates. Millions believe that international human rights take priority over national politics and legislation. Is that true? Where do human rights come from? What are their limits? Most human rights treaties and declarations ground human rights in human dignity. But what is human dignity, and how does it ground rights? Which matters more, security rights or economic and cultural rights? – These are philosophical questions, and the first part of the seminar will focus on them.
Today the human rights movement faces grave political challenges. Human rights NGOs are under attack in many countries; the same with the International Criminal Court. Scholars warn of “the twilight of human rights law” and “endtimes of human rights,” and some argue that human rights treaties have made little practical difference. Others respond that the human rights movement has tangibly and measurably improved human well-being. Conservative critics warn of rights inflation and threats to state sovereignty; some on the left see the human rights movement as a minimalist substitute for global justice that fits too comfortably with neoliberalism.
This seminar will sample some of this writing and explore major philosophical and political issues about human rights today.",LAW 1858 v00,"Human Rights, Then and Now Seminar: Philosophy, History, Prospects",Limit: Varies by section,,,,,David J.

"This course will provide students with a practical understanding of an International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, ICSID, arbitration proceeding from the moment of the submission of a request for arbitration through the issuance of the award and post-award remedies. ICSID is one of the five organizations of the World Bank Group and the arbitral institution most commonly used for the resolution of international investment disputes. ICSID case law has played a major role in the development of modern international investment law.
After a short introduction on the creation of ICSID and its development, students will receive a basic overview of the modern investment treaty regime. The course will then focus primarily on the jurisdictional thresholds that are at the heart of an ICSID arbitration, including the existence of a dispute arising out of an “investment”, nationality requirements, and consent to arbitration under the ICSID Convention. Special procedures, including summary dismissal of the claim under ICSID Arbitration Rules, provisional measures, intervention of non-disputing parties, such as NGO’s or multilateral organizations in the proceedings, transparency requirements and post-award remedies will also be addressed.

"This course will examine the U.S. immigration system through legal and policy perspectives. We will explore the source, scope and constitutional limits of congressional power to regulate immigration; the executive branch implementation of immigration legislation, particularly procedures for entry and removal, and the extent of, as well as constitutional constraints on, Presidential power; and the administrative and judicial review of executive branch action. Close attention will be paid to how membership laws and policies are established and implemented: What laws and policies govern U.S. citizenship? Who is eligible to become a legal immigrant? How are annual admissions numbers set? How and why are family and employment priorities created? How does the U.S. protect refugees? With respect to the arrival of unaccompanied children from abroad, we will consider the laws and policies that govern how the U.S. government treats them. Unauthorized migration will also be examined to understand why some migrants do not use the legal route into the U.S. and what laws and policies the U.S. has in place to deter such unlawful movements at the border and control unlawful presence in the interior. We will analyze the impact of the major 1996 immigration control legislation and its implementation, with particular attention to detention and removal. We will closely examine the role of the Justice Department’s Immigration Courts, with special attention to access to justice issues. We will explore the extraordinary need for, and challenges of, immigration law reform, as well as the particular situation of the Dreamers, children without lawful immigration status brought to and raised in the United States by their parents.

"This class is intended to introduce students to many of the legal and practical issues that today's in-house counsel face. We will cover aspects of the law of professional responsibility and attorney-client privilege that have different implications for in-house lawyers than for outside counsel, as well as the expanding role of the chief legal officer as a business executive in addition to legal advisor. There will be a number of presentations by guest speakers which in combination with class discussion will explore some of the real world challenges of working as in-house counsel including commercial contracts' litigation management; compliance; conducting internal investigations; selection, evaluation and management of outside counsel; crisis management; and balancing relationships with corporate management and the board of directors. The course will also cover career path options and what it takes to succeed as in-house counsel and land the coveted role of the chief legal officer.

"Few areas of law define a society’s values more clearly than public benefits for low-income people.  Policy judgments in this area connect closely to issues about the distribution of wealth and income, race, gender, and immigration, and personal autonomy, and they will be in mind throughout the course.
Policymakers, advocates, and researchers tend to look at these issues separately instead of viewing them in the intersection which represents the real world.   The 1996 welfare law represents dramatically the consequences of making policy decisions without connecting them to a broader framework.  American public benefits for low-income people have always been fragmentary, but the 1996 law was a watershed event that hurt millions of the poorest Americans more than any poverty policy decision since the New Deal. 
The question now is whether we can heal the injury and build from there.  The challenge is to build a more comprehensive understanding and consequently go toward a future that goes in the right direction.  To that end, we will read a mix of historical materials, basic social science research and theory, policy analysis, and cases.  The course will cover the history of the basic structure of the relevant programs, their current configurations, and ideas for the future.
The heart of ending poverty consists of intersecting policies that include good jobs, job supports, in-kind income, and cash assistance, along with other items including child development, education, health, community development and housing, justice both criminal and civil, support for people with disabilities, many kinds of human services, and more.

"The course will be a “soup to nuts” securities offering course, focusing on the legal aspects of conducting an IPO for a U.S. issuer on a Form S-1 and advising the issuer about its future responsibilities as a newly public company. Young lawyers entering a securities practice often find that their knowledge of securities-law principles does not always prepare them for day-to-day challenges of practice in this area.

"The Intellectual Property and Information Policy (iPIP) Clinic casework focuses on counseling for individuals, non-profit organizations, and other groups engaged with intellectual property and information policy matters from a public interest perspective. Past matters have included strategic advising, policymaking, and impact advocacy. Matters vary, but each presents cutting-edge or novel questions while also operating as effective teaching vehicles. The Clinic will not engage in litigation, but there may be opportunities to work on amicus briefs. Students do not need any technical background to participate in the Clinic.
Through the seminar, students can expect to learn about how substantive intellectual property law (copyright, trademark, trade secret, and patent) and information policy (privacy, right of publicity, Communications Decency Act § 230, Freedom of Information Acts, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act) intersect with social justice movements, both historically and presently.
By the conclusion of the Clinic, students will have accomplished the following objectives:
●      Develop knowledge of the core areas of intellectual property law and information policy,
●      Analyze how social justice movements, historically and presently, shape intellectual property law and information policy;
●      Nurture the skillset necessary to become an effective lawyer, including the abilities to think, speak, and write efficiently, accurately, collaboratively, and creatively,

"This course will examine how international disputes are resolved through arbitration in Asia. With the expansion of trade and investment, integration of global markets and the increasing complexity of transactions, international disputes inevitably arise. International arbitration has become the preferred means in Asia by which to resolve cross-border disputes, providing a critical pillar to the stability of international business and financial architecture. The emergence of Singapore, Hong Kong, Seoul and Beijing, among others, as hubs for arbitration offers alternatives to traditional centers such as London, Paris, Geneva or New York. With innovative arbitral institutions such as the Singapore International Arbitration Centre, Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre, China International Trade and Economic Arbitration Commission and Korean Commercial Arbitration Board, a wealth of case law and a mixture of common and civil law jurisdictions, an understanding of the commercial and investment arbitration practice in Asia should help practitioners and students interested in arbitration and Asia.

"This course is structured around a semester-long, simulated negotiation exercise in which the students in this class will represent a US pharmaceutical company (KJH Pharmaceutical Corporation) and the students in a similar class, at the University of Dundee in Scotland, will represent an African agricultural production company (Malundian Cassava Corporation). The two companies are interested in working together to exploit a new technology developed by KJH Pharmaceutical that uses the cassava produced by Malundian Cassava Corporation. The form of their collaboration could be a joint venture, a licensing agreement or a long term supply contract. The negotiations will take place through written exchanges and through live negotiation via videoconference. Substantive law issues related to the transaction, as well as negotiations strategy and related issues, will be addressed in this class.
The purpose of the course is to provide students with an opportunity (i) to gain an introduction to transactional law and experience the sequential development of a business transaction over an extended negotiation, (ii) to study the business and legal issues and strategies that impact the negotiation, (iii) to gain insight into the dynamics of negotiating and structuring international business transactions, (iv) to learn about the role that lawyers and law play in these negotiations, (v) to give students experience in drafting communications, and (vi) to provide negotiating experience in a context that replicates actual legal practice with an unfamiliar opposing party (here, the students at Dundee).
The thrust of this course is class participation and active involvement in the negotiations process. Students are expected to spend time outside of class, working in teams, to prepare for class discussions involving the written exchanges as well as preparing for the live negotiations. Class discussions will focus on the strategy for, and progress of, the negotiations, as well as the substantive legal, business and policy matters that impact on the negotiations.

The other is crimes under international law: war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, and aggression. These are the “core crimes” tried by courts like the Nuremberg Tribunal, the tribunals for Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and former Yugoslavia, and the International Criminal Court (ICC). The Russian invasion of Ukraine, the ICC’s indictment of President Putin, and many states’ proposal to establish an international tribunal for aggression make international criminal law exceptionally salient today.

First, to enhance students’ substantive legal knowledge of international economic law, not only through traditional in-class teaching but also through hands-on work on a specific legal project of high practical importance for their “beneficiary.” Second, the practicum aims to improve students’ professional skills to become successful lawyers, including the ability to analyze complex legal problems, to apply the law to a set of facts, to interact with beneficiaries, to work in groups with other lawyers across cultures and language barriers, to convincingly make oral presentations, to write legal memos or submissions, and to adapt the explanation of legal expertise to a diverse audience. Third, the practicum aims to stimulate personal skills and aspirations of students and to make them aware of professional opportunities in the international law field and discover new challenges. Through interactions with students from diverse background and a diversity of “beneficiaries”, often from other countries and legal systems, participants will build inter-personal skills, learn about other legal, economic, and social systems, and experience the challenges and needs of a wide variety of stakeholders affected by international economic law, extending well beyond traditional issues and stakeholders.
PROJECT WORK: Students will work in small groups (“project teams”) and under the close supervision of one or more Professors (""Supervising Professors""), invited experts (“Mentors”) and the Teaching Assistant (TA) on specific legal questions related to international economic law (IEL) coming from “real clients” (“beneficiaries”) such as international organizations, governments, SMEs or NGOs. In addition, introductory sessions by Mentors will be held to provide substantive background to the respective topics, as well as sessions to improve research and legal writing skills. At the end of the semester, the groups will submit written legal memos or other work products and orally present their projects in class in the presence of the beneficiary and other invited guests. To get an idea of the types of projects done in previous years, see www.tradelab.org.
The practicum is part of the broader TradeLab network and operates in collaboration with TradeLab (www.tradelab.org) to enable beneficiaries to submit projects, to facilitate the operation of the teams and to promote the completed work to the public. TradeLab is an online platform that allows countries, NGOs and other smaller stakeholders easy and smart access to legal talents in the field of trade and investment law, allowing these actors to reap the full development benefits of global trade and investment rules by making WTO, preferential trade and bilateral investment treaties work for everyone.",LAW 1260 v00,International Economic Law Practicum (Project-Based Practicum),,"Prerequisite:

"This course provides an intensive survey of international human rights law and practice, with a principal focus on interpretation and implementation of human rights obligations, commitments, and norms in the practice of states. The course has three main components: in the first unit, we examine the development of the substantive law of human rights and its sources (including treaties, customary international law, and non-binding international instruments). In the second unit, we examine implementation of international human rights in the international, regional, and domestic systems, focusing on UN organs such as the Human Rights Council and treaty bodies as well as regional systems such as the European and Inter-American Courts of Human Rights.  Finally, in the third unit we look at the application of the substantive law and implementation mechanisms in the context of current issues in international human rights, including in the context of atrocities, and the refugee crisis. The course highlights selected contemporary ethical problems in international human rights law such as genocide, crimes against humanity, and torture; application of human rights obligations, commitments, and norms to non-state actors (including corporations); positive duties on states to protect individuals from abuses by non-state actors; universality of human rights and cultural relativism; and the need to protect human rights while countering terorism, including issues relevant to U.S. law and practice.

"This project practicum will provide an opportunity for students to be involved in two projects designed to further accountability for war crimes and other atrocities.
Most of the work will be on the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group (ACA), which is a project established by the United States, European Union, and United Kingdom to assist the Ukraine Office of Prosecutor General (OPG) in investigating and prosecuting war crimes and atrocities committed during the conflict that began with Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. 
A second project is the Innovation Council for International Justice (ICIJ), which is an initiative that will bring together experts from a wide variety of fields to analyze efforts to achieve accountability for war crimes and atrocities in order to draw lessons for innovative future approaches to this challenge. 
In the project portion of the course, students will be involved in activities with the ACA and the ICIJ that will give them a ground-level view of how institutions to provide accountability for atrocities operate in practice. These activities will enable them to acquire skills that go well beyond the typical law school experience, and may include:
(1) coordinating, developing agendas for, attending, and summarizing meetings involving ACA subject matter experts;
(2) helping organize visits to the US by Ukrainian prosecutors, investigators, and officials, as well as ACA events;
(3) working on initiatives requested by the OPG such as a victim and witness support protection and support program;
(4) supporting the collection of information on the Ukrainian population’s experience of the war and their conceptions of what would constitute accountability for harm; and
(5) conducting occasional research for the OPG.
The seminar portion of the course will:
(1) provide students with a solid understanding of how substantive international law attempts to ensure accountability for war crimes and other atrocities;
(2) give them an appreciation of the jurisdictional issues that arise in international criminal law and their implications for seeking justice;
(3) illuminate political and social challenges in creating mechanisms to seek justice for war crimes and atrocities;
(4) prompt consideration of the conceptual and jurisprudential issues involved in ascribing criminal liability to individuals who may have engaged in significantly different activities, through discussion of concepts such as command responsibility and joint criminal enterprise;
(5) invite reflection on ethical questions that arise in seeking accountability for war crimes and atrocities, such as potential tensions between obtaining an end to conflict and securing justice; the concept of a just peace; the extent to which political considerations should inform prosecutorial decisions; the appropriate role in prosecution decisions of local communities who have been harmed by atrocities; and the relative weight in prosecution decisions of considerations such as the gravity of an offense, strength of evidence, public attention, specific deterrence of allegedly culpable individuals, and general deterrence of future perpetrators.
In these ways, the practicum is designed to enable Georgetown law students to serve as leaders in the next generation of lawyers and policymakers devoted to seeking international justice.",LAW 1863 v00,International Justice for War Crimes and Atrocities Practicum (Project-Based Practicum),,,"Note:

"This introductory course deals with the nature, sources and operation of ""public international law,"" with some of the most important contemporary challenges to the international legal system, and with the international community’s evolving responses to those challenges. It includes such topics as the law governing treaties and other international agreements; the recognition of states and governments; methods for international dispute resolution including litigation in the International Court of Justice; the United Nations and other international and regional entities; international human rights and international criminal law; law of the sea and international environmental law; and the rules governing the use of force. Some attention is also given to the role of international law in the U.S. legal system; questions of jurisdiction, foreign sovereign immunity and the act of state doctrine; and the allocation of foreign affairs powers between the President, the Congress, and the Judiciary. We will discuss a few of the most pressing illustrations of the operation – or shortcomings – of the international legal system in the context of current problems or crises. As a first-year elective, this course is intended to offer a contrast or a complement to the bulk of the first year curriculum, by exposing students to the substance and style of foreign and international law materials, institutions, and dispute-resolution mechanisms, and to provide a gateway to Georgetown's rich international law upper class course offerings.

"This course will explore the global fight against impunity -- specifically, as it pertains to curbing war crimes, human rights violations, grand corruption and looted antiquities -- through class discussions, lectures and guest speakers with personal experience in fighting the impunity that is so often associated with war crimes and economic crimes. It is based on the premise that those that are willing to slaughter thousands of innocents, are also willing to steal millions of dollars and loot our collective cultural heritage – and that the fight against impunity includes both war crimes and economic crimes (and often, the international trend to focus on the former, ignores the domestic interest in prosecuting the latter). Over the semester, students in a seminar-size class will be exposed to the basics of international criminal law, international human rights law and international economic crimes, as well how the fight against impunity impacts national security and foreign policy issues. The class will focus on issues related to war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, as well as the recent global efforts to fight grand corruption and recover looted assets and antiquities, including UN Convention Against Corruption and the new UN-World Bank Stolen Asset Recovery (StAR) Initiative. Students will be allowed to write a paper of their choice regarding international law and the fight against impunity.

"Pearl Harbor fundamentally changed Americans’ sense of security. Together with an existential threat in the form of the Cold War, national security institutions rapidly proliferated. Many focused on the collection of foreign intelligence, with the result that by the 1970s, numerous entities were engaged in collecting information on U.S. citizens. Congress responded by passing the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and creating specialized courts to oversee applications for electronic surveillance. Simultaneously, the Executive Branch issued an Executive Order to provide guidelines for all other intelligence activities. Today, FISA, together with Executive Order 12333, provides a framing for the collection of foreign intelligence. Additional instruments, such as National Security Letters, Administrative Subpoenas, and Sneak and Peak Warrants, play a further role in anticipating and responding to threats.
This course, designed for students new to foreign intelligence collection, provides an overview of the key constitutional questions and jurisprudential distinctions. It addresses the statutory and regulatory framework for classified national security information and nuclear-related materials as well as institutional arrangements that comprise the intelligence community. The course then addresses different tools available to the government to obtain information, before addressing some of the most difficult and timely FI questions.",LAW 1832 v00,Introduction to Foreign Intelligence Law,Limit: Varies by section,"Prerequisite:

"As a rule, investigating and prosecuting cybercrime is fraught with challenges. Ephemeral electronic evidence, international evidence-gathering obstacles, and anonymizing technologies can frustrate conventional law enforcement investigative techniques. Recently, distinctions between traditional cybercrimes and crimes committed by foreign actors with national security objectives have eroded, creating new investigative challenges: cybercriminals and national security cyber actors now both steal information for personal financial gain; nation-states have reportedly enlisted criminal organizations to act as their proxies to conduct cyber attacks against United States companies; and the tradecraft used by some nation-state actors includes tools and tactics commonly used by cybercriminals, such as botnets and ransomware. The intersection between conventional cybercrimes and national security crimes with a cyber nexus raises novel legal and policy questions involving the extraterritoriality of criminal statutes, the application of international data privacy regulations, and the boundaries of international legal cooperation. Furthermore, the burgeoning role of private actors in data breach response and cyber threat intelligence gathering are altering how cyber offenses are investigated.
This course will take a practical look at how U.S. federal law enforcement pursues investigations and prosecutions of sophisticated cyber threat actors using investigative and prosecutorial criminal tools that at times are augmented by national security authorities. It will furnish a background in criminal statutes that are the bedrock of electronic evidence gathering (e.g., the Wiretap Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2510 et seq.; the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2701 et seq.; and the Pen Register/Trap and Trace Act, 18 U.S.C. §  3121 et seq.); the substantive laws used to indict cyber actors (e.g., the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1030); the constitutional questions raised by surveillance techniques used to gather domestic evidence against international actors; and national security issues that prosecutors confront when handling hybrid criminal cases (e.g., discovery issues associated with the use of national security authorities). Students in this class will learn how a federal case against transnational cybercriminals and national security cyber actors is built and the legal landmines that can surface while gathering evidence in ""cyberspace.""

"This course will build on the substantive issues covered in the Fall semester by introducing students who are interested in pursuing a career in national security law to the field from both a substantive and practical perspective. The goal will be to provide a foundation for students to make an informed career decision and prepare them with the practical knowledge they will need to succeed in the field.
Students will be exposed to the various potential career paths through presentations by faculty and practitioners. National security law is practiced in traditional hard security sectors, such as by military service members or civilians at the Defense Department or Department of State. However, national security can also be practiced by lawyers all across U.S. government agencies, including Department of Treasury, Commerce, and Justice or in the legislative branch. National security law is also practiced by lawyers in the private sector, from the non-profit sector doing policy analysis to law firms which focus on national security regulations. Introducing students to these career paths, through presentations or with field experience if possible, will be complemented through an informal mentorship program to guide second-year law students through internship and entry-level legal career application navigation.

"The interdisciplinary approach of this practicum - integrating law, business, and public policy - will be of interest to a broad spectrum of students. The practicum will appeal to students interested in becoming entrepreneurs or representing, working with, or investing in startup and early stage businesses, as well as students interested in social and economic justice movements and how innovative business and community development models can contribute to a more just world.  Finally, those interested in how public policy can facilitate the growth of the solidarity economy will find the policy innovations in financing and other areas spawned by this movement to be of great interest. 
The solidarity economy consists of enterprises and organizations like cooperatives, community land trusts, mutual benefit societies, foundations, and community anchored microbusinesses  The central aim of the solidarity economy is to build resident and community wealth by better balancing concerns for profit with concerns for people, communities, and the planet. 
It challenges the prevailing paradigms of individual self-interest, zero sum competition, the prioritization of growth over equity, and extractive forms of profit-maximization that build the wealth of those outside local communities often at the expense of those within them. The solidarity economy values shared ownership models of participatory and economic democracy, environmental sustainability, and more equitable distributions of income and wealth for those living within the communities in which economic activity is generated.  It is particularly interested in how this approach to ordering economic activity can promote equity by closing race, gendered, and place-based wealth gaps - a key driver in a broad spectrum of inequalities.  
SEMINAR: Our two-hour/week seminar functions like a Solidarity Economy Incubator for concepts the professor and/or his community partners are spearheading.  Students will develop skills around some combination of the following: case study and best practices research and analysis, market and financial feasibility studies, business, marketing, and operational planning.  For the seminar projects, students work under the supervision of the professor and seminar advisors.  The premise of the seminar project is that by understanding business models and plans, students can better fulfill their client’s legal needs and develop the capacity to evaluate key aspects of the client’s business.
FIELDWORK: In the field placement, students are supervised by attorneys partnering with the practicum.  In this role, they research legal issues, draft documents, and advise clients affiliated with the Practicum.
Between the Seminar and Fieldwork Projects (15 hours a week), students gain valuable insight into both the legal and business dimensions of a growing solidarity economy movement that promotes racial, gendered and place-based equity through models of shared ownership rooted in the principles of economic democracy.",LAW 1087 v00,Law and Solidarity Economy (Fieldwork Practicum),Limit: 12,"Prerequisite:

"This course is about legal responses to tobacco use, obesity, poor diet, harmful use of alcohol and sedentary lifestyle – the leading causes of preventable disease in the United States, in high-income countries generally, and increasingly, in developing economies.  Cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes and tobacco-related diseases (known as “non-communicable diseases” or NCDs) are society’s greatest killers, but what can law do – and what should it do– to prevent and manage them?
Unlike other global health threats, NCDs and their risk factors are partly the result of consumer choices and transactions lived out every day across the country.  The challenge of creating healthier lifestyles cannot be separated, then, from the regulation of those businesses that all too frequently have a vested interest in unhealthy lifestyles.
Law’s relationship with tobacco, alcohol and food is complex and contested. Nevertheless, governments around the world are experimenting with a wide range of legal strategies to encourage healthier lifestyles.  This course places U.S. developments in a global and comparative context, offering comparisons with legal strategies for encouraging healthier lifestyles in Australia and other countries.
During the course, we will confront some important over-arching questions.  What are the global determinants of NCDs, and how are these diseases being managed, globally?  What do the global solutions look like?  To what extent should law intervene to influence the behavior of populations – as distinct from treating lifestyle-related risk factors as the personal responsibility of each individual?  Does a regulatory approach to the prevention of NCDs imply coercion?  Does it signal the emergence of a “nanny state”?  Do legal approaches to reducing NCD risks necessarily depend on motivating people to consciously change their lifestyles, or can laws embody different strategies?  Is it possible to regulate business without micro-managing or dictating commercial decisions and “legislating the recipe for tomato ketchup?”
Most people want to live longer and healthier lives.  Yet no country can achieve this without addressing the preventable risk factors that drive non-communicable diseases.  This course gives students the conceptual tools to think powerfully about law’s role in the prevention of NCDs, and to participate effectively in debates about appropriate, workable, legal interventions.",LAW 915 v00,"Law, Healthy Lifestyles, and Business Regulation",Limit: Varies by section,,"Note:

"In the first-year curriculum, you are taught to “think like a lawyer.” Because of the predominance of common-law subjects in your first year, this means you are generally taught to think like a “common-law lawyer.” Moreover, you are taught to think this way at the same time that you are also trying to learn the doctrine in those particular areas.
In upper-level courses, however, you will likely turn from common law to law based in statutes and regulations. From tax law to the criminal code, virtually all of modern American law is based on materials produced by legislatures and agencies. Reading and interpreting these materials also requires you to “think like a lawyer,” but like a different lawyer—a “statutory lawyer.”
This course is about the method of statutory interpretation generally. You will not learn the doctrine of any specific type of law in this class. You will learn the process of how to approach a piece of statutory text, how to diagnose the interpretive problem in the text, and how to answer that problem. You will practice the observant reading of text; you will get a framework for breaking down and thinking about a legal question in any statutory case; and you will practice deploying interpretive tools to answer a question in the way that best “zealously advocates” for your client. This course will prepare you for summer legal work, as well as for upper-level courses that rely extensively on statutory law (such as tax, securities, environmental law, labor law, health law, copyright law, etc.)
The course has three overall goals:
1) To provide you with an understanding of the relationships among legislatures, courts, and agencies. The course will include some basic information on how legislation and regulations get created and on the ways in which power is shared in the “making of law.”
2) To teach you the full toolkit of statutory interpretation so that you can diagnose any interpretation question and bring the right tools to bear on answering that question. This toolkit includes elements of the plain text, canons of interpretation, analysis of intent and purpose, and deference to agencies. By unpacking and analyzing these tools used by courts in various decisions, you will learn how to wield them yourself in order to reach different results.
3) To expose you to the theoretical debates around statutory interpretation. The tools that a judge chooses to use often depend on the judge’s theoretical position on statutory interpretation. Starting with materials that will frame the theoretical debate early in the semester, you will return periodically to questions about theory as you become more proficient in the toolkit.",LAW 304 v06,Legislation,,,,,"Mutually Excluded Courses:

In addition, the course will examine campaign finance and lobbying rules as well as the “due process of lawmaking.” Later in the course, we will turn to both theory and practice in statutory interpretation, including theories of interpretation generally, canons of construction, and the debate over legislative history.

"This course is foundational to almost every upper-level class—from tax to securities to environmental law.   Not only will you learn about the basic institutions of our government, but you will learn a very important skill.   Reading statutes is the lifeblood of every American lawyer’s living—for a criminal lawyer, a bankruptcy lawyer, a public interest lawyer or an appellate lawyer, any lawyer.  It is little known, but true, that the Supreme Court’s docket is full of cases about statutes and regulations, and these far, far outnumber constitutional cases.
Most of your law school career, up until now, has been spent learning how to read cases to find the “common law” rule.  This tends to focus you on courts.   But democracy is made up of two other important institutions that are the primary lawmakers:  Congress and the President.   This course focuses you on those entities as authors of statutes and regulations.   We will learn key ways in which courts are different from the elected branches.   And we will also learn an important skill every lawyer needs:  reading statutes.

"Course Description
Despite progress in legal protections for LGBTQ+ and non-binary people, and in the face of recent setbacks, LGBTQ+ communities continue to face systemic obstacles to quality health care such as coverage, refusals of care, substandard care, lack of access to culturally competent care, discrimination, and inequitable policies and practices in health care settings. These experiences correlate with significant health disparities, including greater exposure to sexual, institutional, and state violence, higher rates of tobacco and other substance use, mental health concerns, HIV and other infectious diseases, and cancer. These disparities are even more pronounced for LGBTQ+ people who are also members of other groups that face discrimination because of race, ethnicity, or other aspects of identity—such as Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color, young and older people, people with disabilities, people with low incomes, and immigrants, among others.
In this seminar, students will learn about LGBTQ+ health law and policy issues from a variety of perspectives—including medicine, public health, public benefits, health insurance, social determinants of health, and U.S. foreign policy—and gain a better understanding of the legal and social mistreatment of LGBTQ people at both the individual and community level and its impact on health. Topics covered will include health care access, LGBTQ-inclusive data collection, clinical and cultural competency, disability rights, reproductive justice, and health issues facing LGBTQ+ youth and older adults. This course will also examine how LGBTQ+ individuals and families are treated under federal, state, and international law, and how these policies impact access to health care and contribute to health disparities.
Course Goals & Student Learning Outcomes
The primary objective of the course is to teach students about health disparities faced by LGBTQ+ communities, to identify the laws and policies that contribute to these health disparities, identify legal and policy measures to reduce those disparities, and to discuss emerging issues and topics that affect LGBTQ+ peoples’ health. Through this course, students will learn about the impact that federal, state, and international laws and policies have on LGBTQ+ health, including speakers who are actively working in the LGBTQ+ community at nonprofits, Capitol Hill, and government agencies. Past speakers include attorneys from the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, Lambda Legal, National Center for Transgender Equality, the National Immigration Law Center, and the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS.
This seminar will help students develop critical thinking skills and will provide a clearer understanding of how federal, state, and international laws and policies impact LGBTQ+ health. The course will also highlight how lawyers can use the tools of law (e.g., litigation, legislation, regulatory action) to advance health justice and equity amid a rapidly changing legal and political environment.",LAW 3047 v00,LGBTQ Health Law and Policy,,,,,,Wayne Turner,https://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/?redirect=RzAwODEwNTgx,,,,,F 11:10am-1:10pm (1/16 to 4/27)

"Mediation is a core dispute resolution process, both within the context of courtroom and administrative litigation, as well as in the transactional context. This is true in all types of disputes, including commercial, employment, labor, international, cultural/community, policy, and domestic relations.
This seminar is an intensive, immersive, skills-oriented course designed around a simulated mediation of a complex dispute. Students will use this single mediation problem throughout three intensive days to learn the theory, principles, and practice of mediation advocacy by experimenting with different styles and techniques. Students will engage in various exercises within this simulation, such as selecting the appropriate type of mediator for the dispute, preparing clients that have conflicting goals, and coalition-building among parties with competing goals within mediation. Students will develop hands-on mediation skills that will help them recognize and capitalize on mediator tactics and prepare them to effectively advocate for a client. At the end of this course, students should understand the strategy and tactics necessary to build effective mediated settlement agreements in a multi-party dispute. This course will also prepare students to recognize and handle ethical and confidentiality issues in mediation, as well as the difficulties involved in mediating and resolving a case where the parties will continue to maintain relationships, either in the employment context or in the regulatory context.
The final grade for the seminar will be based on three components (this class does not have a final examination): (1) class participation, including discussion and simulation exercises; (2) a 5-page post-course reflective journal, and (3) a final 10 to 12-page paper creating a mediation advocacy plan addressing a current or recent conflict or dispute in the news.

"Mediation skills have become essential for attorneys working in all areas of practice, whether in transactional or litigation settings, as clients demand cost-effective ways to resolve problems. Many courts require litigants to attempt resolution prior to trial. In this skills-building course, you will develop an in-depth knowledge of the practice and principles of mediation. Emphasis is on learning the skills used by mediators, but also on becoming an effective advocate for a party in mediation. Students will experience the roles of mediator, counsel, and party in various simulations. Special focus is placed on planning for a mediation, for mediators and attorneys/clients, with takeaway materials to use in practice after law school. Several simulations will devote enough time to practice these skills in a full mediation. Various videos and demonstrations will further illustrate the principles. Emphasis will be placed on the ethical rules and guidelines that bind the mediator and advocate.
Class sessions will be devoted to a combination of lectures, preparation for and participation in mediation simulations, discussions, and videotaped mediation topics. Grades will be based upon: (1) the quality of class participation (25%); (2) planning documents and short written assignments (30%); and (3) a final paper, not to exceed 15 pages, evaluating a mediation scenario (45%).

The first half of the course will cover the legal frameworks governing the use of force, including the UN Charter and jus ad bellum, the law of armed conflict (also known as the law of war or international humanitarian law), human rights law, and the U.S. Constitution. Students will examine how the rise of transnational terrorist organizations and advancements in armed drone technology have blurred the line between wartime and peacetime legal rules and placed tremendous pressure on these legal frameworks in the decades following the 9/11 attacks. By the end of this portion of the course, students will be able to analyze uses of military force in the daily news to determine whether the use of force is lawful under domestic and international law.
The second half of the course will cover key issues at the intersection of national security and human rights including: U.S. drone strikes, indefinite detention and the use of military commissions at Guantanamo, the CIA’s torture program after 9/11, the climate crisis, and more. Where feasible, we will cover current events and have practitioners from the field join us for a discussion of the topic. In past years, we have had speakers from the State Department, Defense Department, Congress, and human rights organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Human Rights First.
Student learning objectives for the course are to use class sessions and the preparation of a paper:
To become familiar with basic human rights standards that govern the use of force in law enforcement settings, with particular emphasis on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights;
To become familiar with basic international law standards that govern the grounds for resort to force (jus ad bellum) and regulate the way force may be used in armed conflicts (jus in bello or law of armed conflict/international humanitarian law);
To gain an appreciation of the complex ways in which many current security threats and responses to them have features that do not fall squarely into the categories of either crime subject to law enforcement operations or armed conflict subject to conventional military operations; and
To become familiar with a range of complex issues at the intersection of national security and human rights and the diversity of professional opportunities in these areas.",LAW 1458 v01,National Security and Human Rights Seminar,Limit: Varies by section,,,,,Heather Brandon,https://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/?redirect=RzAwNTY4MDIw,Rita M Siemion,https://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/?redirect=RzAwNTM5MzUy,,,Th 5:45pm-7:45pm (1/16 to 4/27)
"This course will give students an experiential learning experience in the field of natural resources and energy law and policy. Students will work individually or in groups on real-world legal and/or policy problems related to natural resources or energy for clients or stakeholders currently engaged in this rapidly changing subject area. 
The seminar portion of the course covers the key elements of natural resources and energy law and policy related to the experiential learning projects. Students will study the relevant statutes, case law, and underlying policies relating to these natural resources and energy issues. The course is primarily domestic in its focus, but some topics and examples of international natural resources and energy law and policy will be included. During the course, students will draw on pertinent and practical legislative and administrative materials.
Throughout the semester, we will focus on building real-world legal and policy skills. We will discuss the successes and failures of natural resources and energy law and policy, the trade-offs between preservation and development, future prospects for effective resource management and conservation, and the skills needed to effectuate successful outcomes on behalf of clients.
This is a four-credit course, with two credits awarded for the two-hour weekly seminar and two credits for work outside of class on experiential learning projects. The class is designed to be appropriate for both law students and public policy students.
Course Goals:
The course is intended to help you develop your legal skills. During the experiential portion of the course, you will develop legal skills by working on a real-world legal or policy problem for a client. You will prepare a written analysis appropriate for delivery to the client. You will also prepare an oral presentation of your work, including findings and recommendations for the client. In undertaking this project, you will develop in-depth expertise on a natural resources issue as assigned. 
In preparing the written analysis for your client, you will have an opportunity to hone your legal writing and analytical skills. You will consider and determine how best to present your analysis and findings to the client in written form.
You will also develop your skills in oral communication as you prepare and deliver a formal oral presentation of your project for the class and also for your client.
By the end of this course, you should have a broad understanding of the overall legal framework for the administration of domestic natural resources. The focus will be on federal law and policy as it relates to the experiential projects being undertaken by the class, but you should also gain insights into selected state and international topics, particularly the interaction between federal and state law and policy. 
The course should provide you with a context for evaluating ongoing and fast-changing legal and policy issues and controversies relating to energy and natural resources.",LAW 1619 v00,Natural Resources and Energy Law and Policy Practicum (Project-Based Practicum),Limit: Varies by section,,"Note:

"Through experiential, hands-on learning, this course will teach students how to negotiate transaction terms with and against “clients” and each other. Students will be divided into teams and act as lawyers representing the buyer and the seller to draft documents and actively negotiate, demonstrating the various ways in which transactions may progress. Transactions will be based on real life examples and actual transactions from the news will be used as teaching tools. Guests may be invited to join particular classes in order to provide deeper analysis of legal issues in areas such as tax, labor and employment, employee benefits, environmental, real estate, antitrust, FCPA, and intellectual property, tailored to the students’ interests. These guests may play the roles of executives at hypothetical clients, bringing changing facts and positions to a negotiation that must be addressed “on the fly” as in a real life.

"All lawyers, irrespective of their specialty, must negotiate. This intensive, interactive seminar will explore the theoretical and practical aspects of negotiating and mediating transactions and disputes in our legal system. The goal is to improve students’ understanding of negotiation and mediation as well as their ability to negotiate effectively.
Students will learn to negotiate by studying the negotiation theory, concepts and principles, and by participating in simulations and exercises from a variety of practice areas. The simulations are designed to familiarize students with the negotiating and mediation processes, sensitize them to their own negotiating behaviors, teach them how to use a mediator in aid of their negotiations, and raise a number of ethical and practical questions. 
Through in-class negotiation exercises, students will develop and sharpen skills in the areas of listening, asking questions, creative thinking, and persuasive communication. Class lectures and discussions will focus on such topics as the difference between competitive and integrative bargaining, the psychological and ethical dimensions of negotiations, and the importance of context in choosing negotiation strategies. Students will be videotaped while conducting at least one of their negotiations, followed by instructor evaluation and feedback.
Grades are based on the quality of student participation, several short “think pieces” and journal entries based on in-class experience, readings and lectures, and a final 10-15 page paper.

"The deep recession that commenced in 2007 encouraged many in the United States to look to the past for insight on how the American legal order should respond to severe economic dislocation. Many turned to the first two presidential administrations of Franklin D. Roosevelt. For many years, the New Deal had been Old Hat, reviled by conservatives for its statist excesses and deplored by reformers for its bureaucratic rigidities. Suddenly, the Roosevelt administration’s seemed to speak directly to the present. Then, in November 2016, the election of Donald Trump suddenly provided a new, less flattering perspective on Roosevelt, from which his impatience with legal and constitutional proprieties and his ability to galvanize public opinion through a relatively new medium (radio in FDR’s case; Twitter in Trump’s) suggested disturbing parallels.
  This seminar takes up many legal developments from the years 1933-1941: the creation of new federal programs of social insurance, regulation, and public investment; the blazing, by a generation of young law graduates, of a new path into the profession through what had previously been considered a wasteland of government employment; the birth of modern administrative law; a reorientation of judicial activism from the defense of free markets and private property to the safeguarding of civil rights and civil liberties; and a great duel between President Roosevelt and Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, known to history as the “Court-packing” plan of 1937. Over the course of the semester, students will read nine historical monographs as well as articles and book chapters. They will write a Review Essay that evaluates one of the books assigned in the course. Most importantly, they will write a research paper that fulfills the Upperclass Legal Writing Requirement. Class meetings will be devoted to lectures, discussions of the assigned readings, progress reports on students’ research and writing, and a concluding, roundtable discussion of the first drafts.",LAW 626 v00,New Deal Legal History Seminar,Limit: 15,,"Note:

"Proper nutrition is one of the many contributor’s to overall health and could be one of the most cost-effective approaches to address many of societal, environmental and economic challenges facing the world today. Increasingly, law and policy has been recognized as a high-impact and robust approach for accelerating progress toward reducing and managing nutrition-related chronic diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus and certain types of cancer. In various jurisdictions, policymakers enact courses of action, regulatory measures, laws and policies, and set funding priorities designed to address food insecurity, hunger, obesity prevention, chronic diseases, among other health and well-being concerns. This course focuses on policies, programs and practices across the globe—at the national, tribal, state and local levels—that improve or hinder healthy eating. Students will examine the evidence informing these courses of action, along with the historical and contemporary legislative, regulatory and judicial aspects. Topics and themes include dietary guidance, food and nutrition assistance programs, food and nutrition labeling, and other environmental and policy strategies to improve access to healthier foods and beverages.
Student Learning Goals:
Identify key law and policy approaches used across the globe that have been used or have the potential to improve or hinder healthy eating;
Discuss and debate the historical and contemporary legislative, regulatory and judicial aspects of the key nutrition law and policy approaches during collaborative in-class exercises; and

"This course is a continuation of Oral Communication in Law I, but you do not need to have taken Oral Communication in Law I to enroll in Oral Communication in Law II. The goal of this course is to build on your skills to help you become an even more articulate and persuasive communicator in English. To accomplish this goal, your professor, who has an extensive background in oral proficiency multilingual communication pedagogy, guides you through a variety of listening and speaking situations common to U.S. legal practice. Our method includes one-on-one, small and large-group practice in-class, in addition to listening and speaking immersion experiences outside of class.
In this highly participatory class, you will continue to describe, discuss, explain, narrate, and present your thoughts and opinions on a wide range of legal topics by using all major time frames in English (past, present, and future tenses). Furthermore, you will hypothesize, persuade, negotiate, and advocate in English on behalf of a point of view that is not necessarily your own on an even wider range of legal issues. All course assignments are designed to give you practice with the important and relevant areas of oral communication in law, including:
engaging in hypothetical discourse and using persuasion in legal discussions common to U.S. legal practice;
interacting with and comprehending multilingual speakers of English;
reducing any intelligibility issues that might limit others’ ability to understand what you are saying;
engaging in informal professional and interpersonal communication (e.g., networking, day-to-day interactions);
presenting information in formal situations (e.g., at interviews, in client meetings);
taking part in mock courtroom communication, (e.g., oral arguments); and negotiation simulations, and
debating legal topics by adapting your speech and register to different audiences in culturally authentic ways.

"In a project-based practicum course, students participate in a weekly seminar and work on a project under the supervision of their professors. This course explores the challenges and opportunities of using law to address risk factors that contribute to the rising prevalence of NCDs, such as unhealthy diets, tobacco use, and alcohol consumption. By taking an international and comparative approach, it navigates the theory behind the regulation of risk factors to NCDs in relation to concrete examples from around the world, with a particular emphasis on Latin America, where considerable progress has happened in recent years. Students will participate in a two-hour/week seminar and carry out 10 hours/week of project work under the direction of the course professors.
SEMINAR: In every class, students will learn substantive content and develop lawyering skills, leading to a comprehensive understanding of the role of law in relation to risk factors to NCDs, including in policy, advocacy, and litigation. Specifically, students will be introduced to NCDs (definition, risk factors, and global burden); understand the role of corporations as drivers of NCDs; learn about regulations to address NCDs, such as pricing and taxation, labelling and packaging, and restrictions to marketing and advertising; and explore the strengths and weaknesses of regulatory, advocacy, and litigation approaches to NCDs. In navigating these topics, students will develop a set of lawyering skills, including generating and using evidence, monitoring policy, building coalitions, conducting scenario-planning, engaging decision-makers, segmenting audiences, and framing arguments.
PROJECT WORK: On the experiential/field-work side, students will work with external partners of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law (and the newly created Global Center for Legal Innovation Food Environments) on legal and policy projects related to NCDs and the law. For example, students may draft alternative reports to UN bodies analyzing compliance with human rights obligations related to unhealthy diets, tobacco use, or alcohol consumption (e.g., “shadow reports”). Such a report could analyze the prevailing legal frameworks in a particular country and highlight strengths and weaknesses in the statutory and regulatory language. By working with the O’Neill Institute and civil society organizations, the course gives students the opportunity to use law to address critical health challenges.",LAW 1209 v02,"O’Neill Institute Practicum: Regulating Alcohol, Tobacco & Food in International and Comparative Law (Project-Based Practicum)",Limit: 9,"Prerequisite:

"Responsibility in international law—whether attributed to states, corporations, or individuals—takes many forms and is derived from an array of legal, geopolitical, and philosophical sources.

"As a society, we strongly believe in certain myths about the adequacy and fairness of our legal system.  Among those beliefs are that our laws and policies make the American dream available to everyone and provide an adequate safety net to prevent people from falling into the type of destitution we associate with less developed nations.  We take pride in having a legal system that we believe is fair and treats people equally, regardless of income, race, and other characteristics.   
The reality is that our legal system makes promises it does not keep. We do not have the laws and policies we need to protect the poor and other vulnerable groups, and the laws and policies we do have are often inadequate at best and pernicious at worst.  The result is a system where the poor and other subordinated groups are too often left unprotected and routinely feel victimized by the government agencies charged with assisting them.  
A key goal of this course is for students to examine poverty-related laws, policies, and programs and understand how and why our system so routinely fails to protect the most vulnerable members of our society.  As part of this analysis, students will think critically about how and why those laws, policies, and programs have such detrimental impacts on vulnerable groups including people of color, women, children, individuals with disabilities, immigrants, and others. The class will explore the history of poverty policy and the evolution of safety net programs, both of which are inextricably intertwined with racism, gender discrimination, and bias toward certain groups.  It will also examine key Supreme Court cases that shaped poverty law and policy, looking in particular at how the evolution of jurisprudence in the 1960s and 1970s dashed the hopes of anti-poverty advocates that the Court would establish the legal foundation required to truly protect the indigent.  Throughout the course, we will also discuss the politics, the key leaders and thinkers, the noteworthy state and local innovations, and the data with an eye to understanding why our legal system repeatedly fails to live up to its promise, what innovations have been successful, and where we go from here.    
SEMINAR: Classes in the fall will cover the definition of poverty, the history of antipoverty policy, welfare, work supports, and safety net issues. Spring classes will feature guest lecturers covering education, health, housing, homelessness, juvenile justice, and child welfare. Students will be involved in participatory exercises in the course of both semesters: in the fall, mock press conferences, testimony to Congress, and meetings with public officials; and in the spring, a group project on developing a plan for neighborhood transformation, using materials studied through the year. A final paper will be required. Students will earn four graded credits for the seminar (two credits each semester); one grade will be provided at the end of the year.
FIELDWORK: In the four, five, or six-credit, mandatory pass-fail, fieldwork portion of the practicum, students will work with a public interest law organization that deals with issues connected to poverty. Students may work for either 10 or 15 hours in both the fall and spring, 10 hours in the fall and 15 hours in the spring or vice versa, or 30 hours/week in one semester only. If students complete their fieldwork hours for this practicum entirely in one semester, they may be eligible to enroll in a clinic for the other semester.  The host organization may work from either a national or a local perspective on issues connected to poverty. Placements might involve a focus on poverty per se or “poverty and…” e.g., civil rights, women, education, housing, health, juvenile and criminal justice, child welfare or immigration. Depending on the organization, activities at placements could include litigation and/or policy advocacy, including governments on all level and in either the executive branch or the legislative. Students may propose and arrange their own placements; these must be approved by Professor Edelman. Alternatively, Professor Edelman is available to assist in finding and setting up the placements.

A second class relating to the ICA will examine provisions from which no exemptions covering private funds apply and the consequences to private funds and their managers arising from violating the ICA. 
The course will then turn to a consideration over a number of classes of what has become the centerpiece of the U.S. Federal securities laws regulating private funds, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the IAA). The series of classes devoted to the IAA will in turn be followed by a class focused the application to private funds of the U.S. Federal employee benefits law, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA’), a class dealing with recent private fund “hot topics.” The next two classes will center on business and marketing considerations faced by investment advisers and managers when organizing and operating private funds and significant business terms and conditions in private fund documents. 
The last two classes of the semester will be a “practicum” designed to introduce you to a business/legal situation a practitioner in the private fund area could typically face today. We’ll choose the subject of the practicum with student input around the midpoint of the semester. ",LAW 845 v00,"Private Equity, Hedge and Other Private Funds",Limit: Varies by section,"Prerequisite:

"This course endeavors to provide a practical, and practice-oriented (as opposed to academic, philosophical or jurisprudential), approach to the ethical, moral and social issues that lawyers deal with in the practice of their profession. The central objectives are to prepare students to recognize ethical problems when they arise; to identify the pertinent authority--and in particular the ethical code provisions (which we will assume to be the Model Rules of Professional Conduct)--that are most likely to bear on the matter; and to arrive at a sound resolution. Necessary to these ends will be consideration of the ways in which the ethical codes address the often competing interests involved: those of clients, of opposing parties, of non-parties, of the system of justice generally, and of the lawyers themselves. Although the particular focus of the course is on ethical issues, and on the codes and other authority that govern the resolution of such issues, some attention will be paid to putting the subject in a setting that encompasses both a macroscopic view of the role of lawyers in society and a more earth-bound understanding of the processes, disciplinary and compensatory, by which the professional responsibilities of lawyers are enforced.

"In fieldwork practicum courses, students participate in weekly seminars and conduct related fieldwork at outside organizations. This practicum course will provide students with the experience, knowledge, and analytical skills to identify and apply the criminal laws, evidentiary and procedural rules, and case law relevant to the prosecution of sex crimes. Students will participate in a two hour/week seminar and also undertake 10 hours/week of fieldwork at AEquitas: The Prosecutors’ Resource on Violence Against Women.
SEMINAR: In the two-credit, graded, seminar portion of the practicum, students will learn about the prosecution of sex crimes. Rape and sexual assault laws are complex and evolving. The crime of rape originated as a crime against property – not against a person. While these laws have evolved, they still retain vestiges of their archaic origins, resulting in inconsistency and variability in sex crime terminology and elements from state to state, as well as other anomalies. This course is designed to inform students’ evaluation, preparation, and litigation through a course-long review of a complex sexual assault case file. It will also address the prevalence and perpetration of sexual violence in the United States and will explore the commonalities and differences in the barriers to effectively responding to these cases in the United States and abroad. This practicum course will provide students with the experience, knowledge, and analytical skills to identify and apply the criminal laws, evidentiary and procedural rules, and case law relevant to the prosecution of sex crimes. Students will be exposed to research related to victim behavior, sexual violence perpetration, medical and health issues, and forensics in sexual violence cases in their seminar readings, discussion, and fieldwork. Students will be provided with opportunities to apply the relevant research, court rules, and case law to the course case file. The students’ fieldwork will be complemented weekly by a review of relevant case law and literature, class discussion, lectures by the lead faculty member and guest lecturers, and mock pre-trial and trial exercises. Students will develop an understanding not only of the applicable laws but also of common challenges that arise when investigating and prosecuting these crimes. Topics such as alcohol-facilitated sexual assault, violence against sexually exploited women, commonly co-occurring crimes, prosecutorial decision-making, marital rape, issues of force and consent, and more will be studied.
FIELDWORK: In the two-credit, mandatory pass-fail, fieldwork portion of the practicum, students will undertake 10 hours of fieldwork/week at AEquitas, where each student will be supervised by an Attorney Advisor. Students will be expected to assist AEquitas Attorney Advisors with daily tasks of providing technical assistance to prosecutors and allied professionals and to prepare for trainings. Technical assistance requests span the continuum and include but are not limited to: information on experts, legal research (statutory and case law based), policy guidance, and more.
Students will also work in pairs to complete a semester-long project related to AEquitas’s work, focusing on sexual assault prosecution and advocacy. Projects may include:
Utilizing technology to enhance the prosecution of these cases, such as developing a public service campaign to raise awareness of issues related to prosecution and sexual assault and/or creating short podcasts on relevant topics that feature AEquitas Attorney Advisors and other justice system experts, etc.
Developing sample briefs
Analyzing relevant laws
Peer review of colleagues’ work
The fieldwork portion of this class will also include a writing competition where students will be challenged to choose a topic related to their fieldwork, coursework, and relevant research. One student’s work will be selected for publication in co-authorship with an Attorney Advisor.
Learning Objectives:
Effectively prosecute sexual violence cases using an offender-focused and victim-centered approach.
Exercise research-informed discretion to evaluate, litigate, and dispose of cases in a manner that focuses on:
Identifying a just disposition;
Determining the proper path to achieving that disposition under the laws of a particular jurisdiction and leading social science research; and
Considering the impact of decisions on victim safety and well-being.
Utilize rules of evidence and other legal tools to hold offenders accountable for the full range of their conduct.

"The objective of this 1 credit course is to introduce students to the relationship between international laws governing foreign investment and efforts to protect and promote human health.  The course will examine the extent to which bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and investment chapters in trade agreements limit domestic regulatory autonomy, particularly in the field of public health.
International investment law is comprised of over 3000 BITs, which govern the acceptance and treatment of foreign investment.  BITs impose various rules limiting the freedom of domestic policy-makers, including rules governing national treatment, most-favored-nation treatment (principles of non-discrimination), fair and equitable treatment, and expropriation. Foreign investors, including trans-national corporations, are increasingly using these rules to challenge domestic regulations such as public health measures.
The course will address:
the theoretical perspectives underlying the international law of investment and the concept of police powers (particularly the power to protect health);
the different types of legal tests used to determine the regulatory legitimacy of a measure as well as the impact of varying standards of proof on analysis of this type;
rules governing expropriation of property rights and the circumstances in which health and environmental health measures might be considered equivalent to expropriation;
rules governing fair and equitable treatment as used in determining the legitimacy of domestic regulatory measures;
rules governing non-discrimination and their potential impact on domestic health measures that are non-discriminatory in form;
rules governing arbitrary or discriminatory measures; and
procedural issues relating to the participation of civil society in the negotiation of investment treaties and the settlement of investment disputes.
There are no prerequisites for the course, although familiarity with international law or global health law is desirable.

"When lawyers speak professionally, they are often engaging in some form of public speaking. This is true inside the courtroom but equally true in non-litigation settings—whether negotiating the terms of a business transaction, mediating an informal dispute, appearing before legislatures, city councils or municipal boards; pitching ideas to colleagues, clients, or potential clients; speaking to lay groups about various matters of legal controversy, or conducting media interviews for any variety of reasons. 
This course examines best practices for public speaking from both theoretical and practical perspectives.  Through a series of small group exercises and an 8-10 minute persuasive speech on a law-related topic to be given by each student at the end of the week, students will learn how to develop a skill-set essential for building confidence and success to speak in public in any form of law practice.

"Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) are a modern means for pursuing social and policy outcomes and have recently served as a key vehicle for addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. When they work, they mobilize the comparative advantages of the public and private spheres to address key challenges. When they fail, critics cite their worst aspects and argue for a retreat into more traditional roles. Their prevalence means that everyone is likely to come across, and be affected by, such a partnership at some point in their careers.
Serving as a lawyer to a PPP provides an exceptional challenge because the tools and strategies that work when counseling in the public sector may be strange or ill fit for purpose in the private sector (and vice versa). Effective PPP lawyers are translators and guides: they ‘speak both languages’ thus positioning themselves to propose innovative, non-obvious solutions and can build trust with, and among, partners and stakeholders. Bridging theory and practice, students will have the opportunity to understand why PPPs have emerged and the theoretical basis under which they operate. They will also receive practical tools and knowledge to allow them to work with or within a PPP and discuss and debate sophisticatedly how they should be managed and governed.
To do this, the course uses a mix of lecture, discussion, video, and experiential learning. A key feature is a simulation that provides students the opportunity to experience the formation of a PPP using the tools they develop during the semester.",LAW 3067 v00,Public-Private Partnerships: Law and Governance,,,,,,Kevin A.

"This Week One course will introduce students to a critical dimension of lawyering: the law, practice, and ethics of questioning witnesses effectively in non-adversarial and adversarial situations. Through lectures, simulation exercises (i.e., mock depositions, grand jury proceedings, and trials), and oral and written feedback, students gain exposure to the forensic techniques needed to effectively question witnesses in both informal and formal settings, a skill set whose value in the practice of law is not limited to litigation. This course is an excellent introduction to the type of materials covered in upperlevel elective courses such as Trial Practice and Civil Litigation Practice.
The course does not require students to have taken Evidence, but will introduce students to selected key evidentiary issues that they need to understand in order to construct lines of questions and individual questions to elicit responsive answers (or to object successfully to opposing counsel’s questions). For class each evening, students will have limited assigned readings before class (which may include fact patterns and mock documents for the next day’s exercises), and handle questioning in mini-problems involving witness questioning in both civil and criminal practice. The scenarios are expected to include situations such as: (1) informal interviews of corporate employees and other individuals by outside counsel conducting internal investigations of alleged wrongdoing, such as consumer fraud, economic sanctions violations, foreign bribery, organized crime, and SEC disclosure violations; (2) informal and formal interviews of government employees, government-contractor officers and employees, and other individuals by counsel for a Congressional committee investigating alleged fraud against the government; (3) formal non-adversarial questioning of witnesses in civil and criminal depositions, and in federal grand jury proceedings; and (4) formal adversarial questioning of witnesses in civil and criminal trials. Students can expect to be conducting witness questioning each evening of class and to enhance their and their classmates’ learning through a highly participatory and supportive environment.

"This course will consider the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence with regard to religious liberty.  We will look at the Free Exercise Clause and consider how the Court has answered the question “Does the Constitution mandate religious exemptions from neutral and generally applicable laws that incidentally burden religious belief and practice?”  We will look at the Establishment Clause and consider how the Court has answered the question “To what extent does the Constitution allow accommodations on the basis of religious belief and practice?”  This review of Supreme Court case law will highlight the tension between a robust definition of religious rights and the interests of a democratic and pluralistic society.  Today, the legacy of seminal Court cases—particularly, Smith and Lemon—is being seriously called into question as the Court charts a future jurisprudence more solicitous of religious claims.  The doctrinal debate continues--and continues to generate as much heat as light--because the real question is not what standard courts use to review the constitutional validity of laws that affect religious belief and practice.  Rather, the question is, what is the proper role of religion in our civic life?  In other words, the real debate is, at its core, about what kind of social order we want to promote.  Thus, this seminar is not only about the historical treatment of the Religion Clauses and their future consideration, but also about the nature and direction of our civic order.  As with any other constitutional law seminar, the debate between proponents of some form of originalist interpretation and proponents of some form of living constitutionalism will always be in the forefront of our attention.

"This course will explore the law and practice of remedies, the concrete outcome of every litigated case. The rules governing the availability, scope, and interaction of the major remedies — compensatory damages, injunctions, declaratory judgments, restitution, and punitive damages — will be examined in commercial settings. The focus is therefore on remedial responses to violations of rights in tangible and intellectual property, exchange-based rights such as breach of contract, and marketplace rights against improper competitive conduct. Particular attention will be given to the basic concepts underlying remedies law and the policy influences of moral philosophy and economic analysis. In addition, the course will cover the practical and strategic aspects of seeking and resisting judicial relief, including quantification of monetary awards. The reading includes three ""behind-the-scenes"" case studies of how remedies issues are litigated, as well as a classroom visit with an expert witness. Students considering practice in commercial litigation, as well as students who intend to pursue a transactions practice (where prospective remedies are often lurking in the background), will find the course valuable.
Learning Objectives:
Students should learn how to recognize and solve remedies problems. The objective is not to accumulate and catalog a lot of nuts-and-bolts rules, but to develop a critical eye for the fuzzy boundaries and ambiguities that characterize remedies law. In any event, knowing the rules of remedies law is only the starting point; whether litigating a case or negotiating a deal, the challenge is often to construct (or attack) creative arguments about difficult and unsettled remedies issues. Having a coherent understanding of the structure and operation of remedies across a range of substantive fields is essential to meeting such challenges in practice. As the saying goes, mastery lies not in what you know, but in what you do when you don't know.",LAW 268 v01,Remedies in Business Litigation,,,"Note:

"This seminar provides an overview of the policy and legal frameworks driving the growth of the U.S. renewable energy industry (primarily in the wind and solar sub-sectors); the key contractual documents necessary to develop and finance wind and solar power projects; and the legal and market issues facing the renewable energy sector going forward. After becoming familiar with the policy and market landscape for renewable energy projects in the U.S., students (working in groups) will review a set of hypothetical project documents to analyze potential risks and mitigants for a typical project financier. Students will summarize their findings and present to an “investment committee” comprised of practitioners active in the renewable project development and finance industry.
Learning Objectives:
Develop baseline knowledge of key state and federal laws and policies impacting the development and financing of wind and solar energy projects in the U.S., and the interplay between such different levels of regulation.
Demonstrate an ability to analyze and explain a particular state's regulatory regime in respect of the development of certain renewable energy projects located therein.

"The class will focus on reproductive health and the law.  Understanding and learning about the legislative process is essential to this class. Reproductive justice issues span not only constitutional law considerations, but also other aspects of law, society, and the political process.   Topics researched and/or discussed will include abortion, assisted reproduction, contraception, treatment of incarcerated pregnant individuals, pregnancy exclusion laws, rape and statutory rape laws, personhood and feticide laws, surrogacy, the use of child endangerment laws to prosecute women for their conduct during pregnant, and parenthood.
Students will learn how to perform in-depth research and analysis involving these subjects and will then learn the process of drafting legislation, understanding the legislative process, and productively working with legislators, policy makers, advocacy groups, and other interested parties to promote reproductive liberties and enact necessary changes.
All students will gain significant exposure to legal research and writing and will work closely with the instructors to develop and hone these critical skills.

"Whether they are representing couples in transnational adoptions or multinational enterprises in cross-border mergers, legal practitioners increasingly are expected to consult international and foreign legal materials. This course will familiarize students with the best tools for researching international law and the domestic law of jurisdictions outside the U.S., enabling them to approach these tasks with confidence, rather than trepidation. Students will learn how to efficiently locate multilateral and bilateral treaties, decisions issued by international tribunals, documentation produced by the United Nations and other international organizations, as well as legislation and case law from selected foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union. Tools for topical research in specialized fields, such as human rights, international trade, and investor-state arbitration, also will be covered.

"Restorative Justice (RJ) is a distinct form of conflict resolution – rooted in indigenous traditions – that aims to redirect society’s retributive response to harm. For example, crime, in the context of RJ, is not considered an offense against the state but rather a harm against another person with impacts that reverberate through the community. Harm represents an imbalance in the community, not just the missteps of individuals. RJ elevates the role of those involved in and affected by harm in seeking acknowledgment and understanding; restoring relationships, emotional, and material losses; and addressing root causes of the harm through dialogue and problem solving.
Across the country RJ has emerged in public systems (i.e., juvenile and criminal justice, education, child welfare) and in community-based settings. This has increasingly placed lawyers (and judges) in the role of decision makers regarding the use of restorative justice at different stages of the juvenile and criminal justice process (i.e., pre-trial diversion, deferred adjudication, sentencing, and re-entry); co-architects of restorative justice programs; policymakers implementing and integrating restorative responses into legislation; and practitioners of RJ in a variety of settings.
We will be learning about the theory and practice of Restorative Justice in criminal justice, educational and community settings, exploring is challenges, possibilities, and interface with legal systems. The course will involve advanced readings, group work, activities, guests, and simulated restorative processes to gain an experience for what readings and academic discussions cannot offer.

"This fieldwork practicum course focuses on issues of sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics from an international and national human rights law perspective. The course will provide an overview of the main human rights issues in these fields, while affording students an opportunity to work with organizations that are addressing human rights violations of people based on sexuality, gender and sex characteristics, in various ways.
As such, students participate in a two-hour weekly seminar and work for 10 hours/week for at least 11 weeks during the semester at an outside organization.
Background: Every day, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQI) people are victims of multiple human rights violations, which are directly linked to the lack of acceptance (by society and the State) of their non-normative sexualities, gender identities or gender expressions. Some of the most common human rights violations of LGBTQI people include killings, torture, ill-treatment, “corrective” or punishing rape, ""conversion therapy,"" discrimination in schools, in the workplace and in accessing health services, among many others. Intersex persons face human rights violations because of the general lack of acceptance of their bodies that differ from the socially accepted standards of “female” and “male” bodies. Because of their sex characteristics, intersex people often face human rights violations including irreversible non-consented and non-medically necessary genital surgery at the early stages of infancy and throughout childhood, as well as forced sterilization, among others.
SEMINAR: The course will take a close look at some of the human rights violations faced by lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer and intersex (LGBTQI) people, or other people perceived as such, as well as the corresponding States’ obligations under international human rights law. The students will analyze landmark and recent decisions emerging from regional and international human rights monitoring bodies, which have developed standards around these categories. This analysis will provide a solid legal foundation for students to develop their projects for external partners.
FIELDWORK: Students will be placed with organizations working in the area of sexual and reproductive rights. Most likely, the work will be conducted remotely, as several of these organizations are not based in the Washington D.C. area. The work conducted for this portion of the course will be supervised by the external organization.
In the past, the work with external partners specific human rights issues faced by LGBTQI people, included collaborating on several policy and legal projects, including preparing shadow reports to present before international human rights bodies, conducting analysis of legislation or a related case, among others. External partners vary every year, and include international and domestic leading human rights organizations working on the promotion and protection of the rights of LGBTQI people at the international and domestic level.",LAW 1353 v00,"Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, Sex Characteristics and International Human Rights Law (Fieldwork Practicum)",Limit: 8,"Prerequisite:

"Your phone rings. It is your Colombian client, and he has just been wronged! He needs your help to bring this bad-actor to justice. But not all of the relevant conduct took place in the United States, and you are not a Colombian lawyer. Where do you begin? Do you bring a claim in a Colombian court? Do you file suit in the United States? Does it make a difference? What causes of action can you bring? What law governs? If you do bring suit abroad, can you get information from the United States? As globalization in business increases, the need for cross-border litigators equally increases.
This simulation course, taught around a hypothetical fact pattern, is designed to be a hands-on introduction to initiating and defending against a cross-border litigation. Students will become familiar with topics unique to cross-border litigation, such as what law applies to your client’s claim, where can you bring this claim, and how to obtain discovery in the United States for a legal proceeding abroad. Students will learn practical skills such as factual investigation, legal drafting and reasoning, and oral advocacy.
The course is divided into three parts: Part I will focus on initiating a cross-border litigation, including the strategy motivating where to file and what to allege. The course will begin by giving students an opportunity to interview their “client” and gather factual information to support their client’s potential claims. At which point, the class will be divided into two groups. Group 1 will decide to file their claims in the United States and prepare a Complaint seeking a preliminary injunction while Group 2 will decide to file their claims elsewhere, but still use the U.S. Courts to help with discovery, and prepare a 1782 Application.
Part II of this class will focus on defending against the initiation of a cross-border litigation. Group 2 will prepare a Motion to Dismiss Group 1’s Complaint, and an opposition to the preliminary injunction, while Group 1 will prepare an opposition to Group 1’s 1782 Application.
Part III of this course will focus on oral advocacy. Each student will be required to give an oral argument related to either the Motion to Dismiss the Complaint or the 1782 Application.",LAW 1729 v00,Special Topics in Litigation: Representing Foreign Clients in U.S. Courts,,"Prerequisite:

"The biggest challenge of a multistate tax practice is dealing with the practical issues of multiple states with sometimes conflicting laws and regulations. Most companies operate in multistate environment and must learn how to apply their operational realities to a patchwork of state and local tax laws and regulations.

"Please see the Street Law website and this video for more information about the course.
OVERVIEW: Street Law Mock Trial Advocacy s a project-based practicum course where Georgetown Law students teach a course in mock trial advocacy at DC public high schools (day students) or the DC Jail (evening students). Enrolled law students develop and refine critical lawyering skills, including legal research and writing, time and project management, public speaking, and the capacity to engage diverse audiences in a low-risk, high-reward environment. Street Law instructors help the local community better understand the law, identify how it impacts them, and develop legal and analytical skills. In short, Street Law instructors have a tangible impact on the lives of local residents. 
The spring semester focuses on trial and litigation skills. Street Law instructors prepare their students to compete in a mock trial tournament. The law students develop a thorough understanding of trial procedure, law, and effective advocacy skills. This practicum allows law students to actively give back to the local community while gaining invaluable lawyering skills.
SEMINAR: The seminar uses interactive instruction to explore law and legal reasoning, mock trial advocacy skills, classroom management, lesson planning, and student assessment. Law students have time to collaborate with their peers and also gain access to additional lessons they can use in their classes. Outside of the seminar, faculty provide intensive support and collaborate with each student to support and encourage their learning and growth. 
PROJECT WORK: The placements are determined primarily by the law student’s schedules for the semester. All classes will be taught in person. There, they will work for at least 10 hours/week preparing for and teaching a course in practical law. Law student instructors have the primary responsibility for the instruction and grading of their students. Street Law faculty and fellows observe each law student instructor and conduct post-observation debriefs at least three times per semester. Guiding students through the mock trial process is remarkable and unforgettable. 
Regular and punctual attendance is required at all practicum seminars, field placements, and scheduled events. If a student must miss a seminar, a Street Law event, or project work, he or she must speak to the professor as soon as possible to discuss the absence. Unless the professor indicates otherwise, a student with more than one unexcused absence from the practicum seminar, or one week of unexcused absences from the fieldwork or project work, may receive a lower grade or, at the professor’s discretion, may be withdrawn from the practicum course.
ORIENTATION: There is a three-day orientation required for this practicum course. Orientation will be held from Tuesday, January 9, thru Thursday, January 11, from 10:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.  Law students will experience the student-centered teaching methodology they will use in their own classes and have a chance to practice facilitating before entering the classroom. Attendance at the orientation is mandatory. Evening division students should reach out to practicum faculty to discuss orientation schedule conflicts. Attendance at this orientation is mandatory for students who did not already take the fall semester Street Law: Criminal Justice and Human Rights practicum.

"This is a three credit course, and class meets for two hours and forty-five minutes each Thursday between 2:45 and 5:30 p.m. The course has five primary aspects:
First, we will focus on the Supreme Court as an institution and how it differs from other American courts.  This will include readings and discussion of topics of longstanding importance, including the certiorari process, merits briefing, the role of amicus briefs, and the Solicitor General’s Office.
Second, we will study in depth several cases being decided this Spring.
Third, through two short (10-12 pages, double spaced) writing assignments and opportunities for extensive one-on-one discussion and comment, there will be a heavy emphasis on effective legal writing.
Fourth, we will focus on effective oral advocacy, as practiced in the U.S. Supreme Court, including multiple opportunities to observe and participate in such practice arguments yourself.   We will have three extra two hour sessions on Friday afternoons during the term to observe actual moot courts in pending cases conducted by the Supreme Court Institute.
Finally, we will also spend substantial portions of many classes considering materials addressing events which have occurred over the last half century relating to the Court’s role in constitutional interpretation, including how that role has changed greatly within the recent past as a result of changes in the make-up of the Court.
Because that Court itself plays a unique role in our legal system—to identify and resolve important disputed and recurring issues of federal law—the role of counsel in that Court is markedly different in many respects than it is in other appellate courts.  These differences are most obvious in the certiorari process, by which the Court identifies the cases it will hear on the merits.  That process demands that counsel on both sides persuade the Court that the case at hand either does or does not clearly present a legal issue of such moment and controversy as to demand the Court’s attention.  We will study the certiorari process, consider at some length the features of a case that enhance or detract from its chances for certiorari, and focus specifically on the tasks of drafting certiorari petitions, oppositions to certiorari, and reply briefs.
After the Court grants review of a case and it forward for decision on the merits, the selective nature of the Court’s jurisdiction, and its focus on resolving recurring legal issues rather than simply deciding cases, shapes the lawyer’s approach to the case in many important respects.  These peculiar aspects of advocacy in the Supreme Court will be discussed in several class sessions dealing with the tasks of drafting merits briefs, including briefs of petitioners, respondents and reply briefs.  We will also discuss the role of the amicus briefs and the ways in which they can contribute to the Court’s decision.
The unique nature of the Supreme Court’s decision making role is substantially reflected in the nature of oral advocacy as it is now practiced at the Court.  We will deal with the nature and challenges of oral argument in the Supreme Court beginning with the first class, and then again more intensely in a number of class sessions.  In addition to reading secondary sources addressing oral argument in the Court from a variety of perspectives, all students will participate as both advocates and judges in several moot courts of cases being decided by the Court this Spring.
We will also observe and discuss moot court arguments by advocates in upcoming cases in the Court. We will be attending three such arguments in sessions lasting two hours, each to be held on a Friday afternoon.  Given uncertainties in the moot court schedule prior to issuance of the Court’s monthly calendars, all enrolled students are required to keep their schedules clear for six dates listed in the syllabus, though we will only be using three of those dates for the two hour sessions. 
We will have as guest lecturers a number of experienced Supreme Court advocates.  These occasions will afford you a unique opportunity to talk first hand with Supreme Court experts about their roles and choices in handling historic and important Supreme Court cases.  I hope you will make the most of these opportunities.
Finally, beginning in 2023, as a result of major changes in the Court’s make-up and approach to its work, the curriculum now includes substantial attention to materials addressing these changes.  This study will take a predominantly historical approach, focusing on how developments that began in the 1970s and 1980s are directly related to changes that have occurred much more recently.  We will also focus substantial attention on more recent developments, including the dominant role today of original meaning jurisprudence, the increasing rate of reversals and the declining respect for precedent, some radical changes in broadly important legal rules that have stood for many decades, and the recent decline in reported public trust in the Court.  These issues will be approached primarily through  discussion in which active participation will be encouraged and to which all viewpoints will be welcomed and respected.  The professor, while actively inviting all viewpoints to the discussion, will not hide his own perspective, which is substantially critical of many recent developments.

"This course explores high-profile cases on the Supreme Court’s current docket and approaches to advocacy before it.  The current term presents an array of significant issues that have the potential to transform myriad areas of law.  We will examine the briefing and arguments in selected cases and break down the different tools that sophisticated advocates use to persuade the Court.  In addition to learning about the substance of cutting-edge issues, students will learn about and practice oral and written appellate advocacy — skills that translate well to any type of practice.  Our analysis of specific cases also provides a springboard to consider broader questions about the Court’s role in our system of government and how the Court manages the content and pace of its own docket.  To gain additional perspectives on the Court and the appellate bar, we will hear from guests with varied experiences and roles in appellate advocacy.  Past guests have included federal appellate judges, government officials, Supreme Court reporters, and experienced practitioners.

"This course is designed as a survey course for those students not pursuing a SALT Certificate in conjunction with their LL.M. in Taxation, Executive LL.M. in Taxation, or MSL Program. The course begins by first introducing the student to the dynamics and taxonomy of SALT, and why (out of necessity) the study of subnational taxes must vary from the “classic” pedagogy of most LL.M. – Tax programs that have come to focus and build on a study of the differing subchapters of the Internal Revenue Code.  Next, the course explores important subnational topics not encountered in the study of federal corporate income taxes, such as federal limitations on the powers of subnational governments to tax.  To close the course, the student will be presented with a case study and a comparative law analysis that will provide them insight into analytical approaches employed by interdisciplinary tax teams made-up of international, federal and subnational tax specialists assigned to deal with enterprise restructurings.
SALT issues unique to following types of taxes will be explored: income based taxes; sales and use taxes; ad valorem taxes; unemployment taxes; real estate and controlling-interest taxes; transfer taxes; gross receipts taxes; capital stock (net worth based) taxes; excise taxes; and, other taxes to illustrate the diversity of subnational levies and how they can be of critical importance to select industries and their advisors, e.g., such as the insurance industry (premium and retaliatory taxes); the natural resource industry (severance taxes); the communication industry (telecommunication taxes); and, the health care industry (hospital and medical provider taxes).
In addition to overviewing key taxes, the course will introduce the student to other important topics that routinely engage multijurisdictional enterprises, including: unclaimed property (“escheat”) audits; issues implicated by operations and transactions within and without the U.S.; statutory and negotiated tax and non-tax incentives; and, the nonuniform taxing and sourcing rules that face unincorporated multijurisdictional enterprises and their owners that choose to operate through partnerships, limited liability companies, S Corporations or joint ventures.",LAW 2072 v00,Survey of State and Local Taxation,,"Prerequisite:

"Sustainability issues such as climate change, human rights and racial justice have become the defining challenges of business. International corporations must navigate a complex web of regulatory and policy challenges to assure their long-term viability. In response to statutory, investor and customer pressures, Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors are fundamental to how Boards and Senior Executives are valuing strategic opportunities and their overall risk profile. Lawyers will play an increasingly critical role in advising on trends related to: (i) the greater integration of sustainability within policy and legislation; (ii) the appetite of investors for ESG considerations within their investment portfolios; (iii) the demand for greater transparency and uniform disclosure; (iv) the growth of green and social impact investment products; and (v) the heightened calls for racial equity and social justice. This course will provide a general overview of the statutory and regulatory frameworks required to advise businesses on these ESG challenges and explore how evolving interpretations of “fiduciary duty” and “corporate purpose” may help or hinder the ability of business to make a meaningful impact on climate change and other social issues.

"The “tax research” portion of the course will cover the hierarchy of authority and other information sources most relevant to tax lawyers.  We will begin with an overview of the federal tax legislative and regulatory processes and their research trails.  Next, we will explore the universe of subregulatory guidance, written determinations, and other information produced by the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service.  Then, we will dive into the world of judicial opinions and examine the three choices of forum available for litigating a federal tax dispute.  The final “tax research” class will focus in depth on U.S. international tax research and, in particular, on tax treaties and the role thereof in the U.S. tax system.

The “writing” portion of the course will focus on developing effective legal writing skills.  The ability to succinctly—and authoritatively—convey one’s thoughts in a written work product is an essential skill in the legal profession.  The strength of a legal argument depends not only on the sources of authority cited but also on the manner in which those authorities are presented.

"International tax treaties determine why hedge funds are located where they are, how motion pictures are financed, whether the dispatch of employees abroad is economical, and why financial assets follow prescribed international paths. They determine why Netherlands and Luxembourg have a large positive balance of trade with the United States, and why recording studios are established in the Caribbean. They determine whether bank accounts in Switzerland and Liechtenstein are really secret. While tax treaties ostensibly are only about dividing up tax bases between countries and exchanging information between sovereigns, in reality they channel the flow of investment and development in the global economy.
This course assumes that students have some familiarity with basic tax treaty concepts and examines how provisions of the OECD Model Treaty and the United States Model Treaty are used by tax practitioners to achieve specific business objectives. Students will acquire an understanding of how treaty provisions help shape economic and financial decisions in different industries and economic sectors. The course uses examples drawn from actual practice to illustrate the creative use of tax treaty provisions. It is designed to be an interactive experience, with students working on case studies, discussing alternative approaches, and using different jurisdictions and changes in the form of the underlying transaction to achieve desirable tax results.
Learning objectives:
This course is intended to teach the concepts underlying the United States Model Tax Treaty and the OECD Model Tax Treaty. By the end of the course, students are expected to understand how tax treaties are organized and be able to apply the model tax treaties to factual situations in which the tax treaties are applicable.
At the same time, the course is intended to challenge the student to be aware of the ethical challenges and risks of practice in the area of international taxation. More and more, tax authorities are not only looking to penalize a taxpayer for improper tax planning, but also the tax advisor who recommended the course of action followed by the taxpayer. By the end of the course, students are expected to be able to understand where the borders of ethical behavior are when developing international tax structures and to be able to analyze risks to the clients and themselves when working in this area.
Finally, the course is intended to reinforce principles of close reading and attention to the specific wording used in the tax treaties and cases interpreting the tax treaties. By the end of the course, students are expected to be able to read and understand why specific words are used in tax treaties and the significance of these words.",LAW 846 v00,Tax Treaties,,"Prerequisite:

"The energy industry has undergone dramatic change in recent years. The US power sector is undergoing a transformation from a coal-based sector to one that now has incredible diversity between natural gas, wind, solar and even nuclear energy now leading the way in new development. Likewise, the oil and gas sector has seen a revolution in responses to changing US energy policy and energy politics. More so than almost any other industrial sector, energy is highly influenced by the tax law. The economics of renewable and alternative energy is highly dependent on specific tax credits designed to encourage their development.
This course will examine these important areas of energy tax policy:
taxation of electric utility and natural gas markets (including tax changes flowing from deregulation of these markets),
tax subsidies and tax incentives for alternative energy development (including analysis of creative tax-planning structures designed to maximize the value of these incentives), and
new tax incentives included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.
The course is designed to help students appreciate the role tax plays in the generation of energy in the US and issues confronted by tax practitioners in this rapidly changing environment.

"This course focuses on transnational legal problems.  Transnational legal problems are problems that involve citizens of more than one country or involve activities that take place or have effects in more than one country.  Transnational legal problem-solving skills are important not only for lawyers working in the fields of human rights, international business, international dispute resolution and other distinctly “international” areas of practice.  They also are important for lawyers that do not have an international focus, because transnational legal problems frequently arise in diverse areas of law thought to be “domestic”—such as family law, environmental law, product liability litigation, civil rights litigation, criminal law, corporate law, and others.
Course Goals
The primary goal of this course is to give you an opportunity to learn how to analyze and advise clients on three fundamental issues that surround virtually any transnational legal problem:
What is the applicable law?  National law?  If so, U.S. law or foreign law?  International law?  Private rules?
What transnational dispute resolution methods are available and most appropriate?  Litigation in a national court?  If so, a U.S. court or a foreign court?  An international court?  Through alternative dispute resolution methods, like arbitration?
How can the outcome of a transnational dispute resolution process be enforced?
Another goal of the course is to provide a foundation for students wishing to pursue advanced study of international, transnational law or comparative law, including international litigation, international arbitration, international trade, international investment, human rights, or international business transactions.",LAW 1866 v00,Transnational Law and Practice,,,"Note:

Learning Objectives:
In this practice-oriented course, students try three civil cases. Students act and are treated as counsel, and work with motions in limine, jury selection, opening statements, direct and cross-examination of lay and expert witnesses, demonstrative evidence, and closing arguments. The course emphasizes jury persuasion, exhibits, courtroom tactics and demeanor, and adapting to trial judges of varying demeanors. Students not assigned as trial counsel serve as witnesses and jurors. Proceedings are conducted pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Evidence.
Students are assigned to teams, but a student's final grade will be based upon that individual's presence, punctuality, preparation, participation, and performance, with emphasis upon the progress observed throughout the semester. Students are encouraged to set and share personal goals to facilitate assessments throughout the semester. Assessments are necessarily subjective, with preparation, participation, performance, and progress weighted most heavily. Lack of participation is the greatest detriment to a “good” grade, because it makes preparation and progress difficult to perceive. Students may be given mid-semester feedback upon request.

"Understanding and dealing with U.S. export control and sanction laws have become increasingly important skills for lawyers advising clients who compete in the global economy, including manufacturers, service enterprises, financial institutions, and companies licensing their technology abroad. This course surveys the federal laws and implementing regulations governing the export and re-export of goods, services, technology and software from the United States or by persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction, the extraterritorial reach of re-export controls, prosecution strategies, restrictions on dealings with or in sanctioned countries, prohibitions against dealing with blacklisted parties, and other sanctions that apply to non-U.S. companies and individuals. We also will examine the policies underlying these rules, which are designed to address ever-changing and developing threats to the United States, including Russian aggression in the Ukraine, the nuclear threat posed by Iran, civil war in Syria, missile development in North Korea, and conventional military tensions between the United States and China.
The course is designed to impart the practical skill sets and strategies you will need to use and understand the complex regulatory regimes underpinning U.S. export controls and sanctions, and to communicate effectively with the relevant government actors.  The applicable laws include statutes such as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Trading with the Enemy Act, Arms Export Control Act, the Export Control Reform Act, and regulations issued by federal agencies such as the U.S. Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and State.  Our study of these rules will include review of case law, agency guidance and prior government enforcement actions.
The course also will focus on the enforcement environment, including the trend of ever-increasing fines, the use of extradition, and imprisonment. We will discuss defense strategies and the potential for global settlements with the Departments of Justice, State, Treasury, and Commerce.
Finally, the course will emphasize developing the working knowledge necessary for hands-on practice and problem-solving in this field. In addition, the course will provide skills sets to assess proposed legislation and regulations in depth, as well as advocacy skills related to legislation and rulemaking.
